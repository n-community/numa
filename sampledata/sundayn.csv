<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>
<p>I apologize that <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/SlappyMcGee""><em>SlappyMcGee</em></a>
couldn't make this issue. It would have probably been quite funny and
irrelevant.</p>
<p>
At first glance, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Borealis""><em>Borealis</em></a>
is just a regular guy. He hangs out on the IRC fairly often and has a
pretty average post count. It's when you get to know him a little
better that you realize what a cool dude he is. He's a proficient
mapmaker and all around nice guy, but what really sets him apart is his
music. His band is called <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=12097"">Noctambulant</a>
and it is quite good, if I do say so myself.
</p>
<p><strong>Tanner: What's it like being one of the oldest [age-wise] members of
the Metanet community?</strong><br />
Borealis: It makes me feel...arthritic, to say the least! It's the big
3-0 this year, as well. Although, it's a good thing that there are a a
wide range of ages within the community, and it really highlights N's
appeal factor. Plus the age gives me lots of stories to tell.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: What kind of maps would you say that you make primarily?</strong><br />
Borealis: I'm not really sure. If you went by categorisation, it would
be Action maps, definitely. As for an actual style however...it's a
hard thing to define. There is something weird in there, particularly
the tilesets. But I'd like to think there are also some elements
reminiscent of the Metanet levels in their.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: I hear you're planning a map pack. What are the workings
behind that?</strong><br />
Borealis: Indeed I am. In fact, it's well past the planning stages, it
even might be out by the time this gets published! It's a rather odd
collection of levels, because, usually in a map pack, it's either lots
of authors all doing roughly the same amount of levels, or just one
author. This one is actually an amalgam of both. I also think it's one
of the quickest multi-author map packs from conception to release - I
only started organising it at the end of December. It's a pretty good
line up as well, I reckon. There's me, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Caero""><em>Caero</em></a>, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/DemonzLunchBreak""><em>Demonz</em></a>,
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/lord_day""><em>lord_day</em></a>, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Qix""><em>Qix</em></a>, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/yahoozy_Guacamole""><em>Yahoozy</em></a>
and <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy""><em>Kablizzy</em></a>.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: How'd you get <em>Kablizzy</em> to agree to doing a map pack
with you?</strong><br />
Borealis: Haha. Well, it's probably a bit easier than you'd think.
Since we're of the same orientation - map-making wise, at least - it's
actually quite easy. Obviously the key thing is not to demand too much
from him - there is only so much one bunny can do after all!</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Anything exciting happening with Noctambulant?</strong><br />
Borealis: Well, we're pressing ahead with the recording of Omen, which
is a long and arduous process, however very much enjoyable nonetheless.
I've just been penning some lyrics for a new song, in fact. The thing
with making this type of music is that the entirety of it's production,
from origin to packaging - it's just really one long journey. We've
been at it for 2 and a half years now, with breaks, naturally. I've
certainly enjoyed following the process.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: How did Noctambulant get its start?</strong><br />
Borealis: Funnily enough we're in the process of writing a short
biography for the album sleeve, but it's way too long for here. So this
is a condensed version. I started out in 1992, making a crude variety
of thrash in my post-school band, Martyrium. There I met with Jon
(Noctambulant's drummer). However, as a band we didn't last long. Me
and Jon went through university pretty much together, and we became
better with our instruments. In 1995 we formed Noctambulant, and again
stayed with metal up until 1998, when we had a bit of an argument and
fell out with each other. During the period we were split up, we both
explored other types of music, mine predominantly being jazz. I learnt
to play the alto saxophone, which now has a smooth but fairly large
role in the smoother aspects of Noctambulant's music. In 2004 we
reformed as a trio with Jeff, and began writing a demo. The demo
eventually worked it's way into a full album, and as we see it now, a
2CD album. Our ideas have progressed infinitely since, though, so the
music has changed rather drastically in the relatively short time
period. I'll stop typing this now.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you have any advice for aspiring musicians?</strong><br />
Borealis: Very much so. Don't be afraid of the avantgarde and
progressive styles of music, otherwise you'll find yourself making
boring pop droll, going nowhere. Pick one instrument and stick with it.
You can change the styles of how you're playing, but, until you're
playing at your peak, you're not ready to move onto improving another
aspect of your musicality. And the third is a simple one; Practice,
practice, practice!</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: If you were a monster truck what name would you go by and
why?</strong><br />
Borealis: Well, it would have to be a snappy, sharp name. However,
contrary to that, I think I'd go for ""Ujaku"". It sounds exotic, but
it's actually the name of a <a
 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_City_%28band%29"">Naked City</a>
song, with excellent squealing free-jazz-style alto sax. The same
squealing you get at the racetrack and such. Hehe, a loose connection,
I know, but a connection nonetheless.</p>
<br />
<p>
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/use/LittleViking001""><em>LittleViking</em></a>
came up with that last question at my request. He will also be joining
us next week. S'gonna rocking fuck.</p>"

<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>
<p>
While <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch""><em>krusch</em></a> is both a wonderful mapmaker and just a generally awesome person to have around, the real reason I wanted to interview him is because he shares my name. Enjoy.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Hello, again, and welcome to Nterviewed. With us tonight is the loverly krusch. How are you krusch?
</strong><br />krusch: I am grand. Thank you. Just playing some Pok&#233;mon.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Ha ha. You're generally known about the community as sort of an eccentric. The <a href=""http://n.wikia.com/"">N Wiki</a> describes you as a ""younger, more post-modern <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/LittleViking001""><em>LittleViking001</em></a>."" Do you think that's accurate?
</strong><br />krusch: Probably. D: I do love LV's maps. Absolutely adore them, and I definitely draw inspiration from that guy. Yeah. I'd say I'm more of a younger LV, who doesn't know what he's doing half of the time. : /
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Is there one map in particular that inspires you or that you like the most?
</strong><br />krusch: Hmm, it's hard to pick one. LV&#8217;s Legacy work is just gorgeous, but I think I'd have to say the LV Chronicles were his best work. In particular the famous <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/8229"">""In Soviet Russia, Baby Eats You!""</a> So let&#8217;s say that one.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Is there any one thing in your own life experience that inspires the most maps?
</strong><br />krusch: Hooo. I'd have to say music or art. Painters like Gustav Klimt who work with beautiful patterns really make me want to play with Ned in a similar fashion. And bands like the Arcade Fire with their very emotional lyrics get me going too. :D But nothing directly from my experience comes to mind. Except perhaps the place I live, which is out in the country. Lots of rivers, forests, mountains, etc. Sometimes I draw inspiration from that, too.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Awesome. Do you think the quality of all maps, on <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/"">NUMA</a> or in a pack, is increasing or decreasing?
</strong><br />krusch: I'd have to say increasing, because I just can't see how a large group of people could all get worse at something with practice. But I guess I play more older maps than newer ones. Yeah, it's a strange thought. I'd still say the quality is increasing, though. Yes, increasing.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: How do you think your own mapmaking style has evolved?
</strong><br />krusch: Oh, hum. I think my style just changes as the things that appeal to me change. My first maps were often based on you being a ninja. And doing ninja-ly things, like rescuing people, robbing places. :D Then I learnt about making visually stimulating maps. And still, I try hard to make my maps visually appealing. I love making maps with rhythm too. Rhythm is a vague and hard to describe term, but good rhythm makes for a good map, definitely.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: I think NUMA just went down during the course of this interview. 'Snot a good omen.
</strong><br />krusch: Yeah, I noticed. :(
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Which of your own maps is your favourite?
</strong><br />krusch: I'd probably have to say <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/54376"">The Dangermouse</a>. I love the style in that, an unrestrained kind of pattern. And I love the gameplay, the flats, the thwumps and the rocket. I made it totally quickly, too. The bulk of it was done in under 10 minutes. Tweaking took about 30, from memory.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you think you'll ever stop making maps?
</strong><br />krusch: Not until I grow up, that's for sure.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/blue_tetris""><em>blue_tetris</em></a> just turned 27 and he's still going strong.
</strong><br />krusch: Ooh, good point! That guy rocks, though. I don't think I'll be here in 11 years. Or I will be and my maps will be staaaale.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you look forward to learning an entirely new set of rules for mapmaking when Robotology (the game that is currently under development  by Metanet) comes out?
</strong><br />krusch: Haha. Do I ever! I'm curious to see how it works. Very curious. With the whole ropes/grapples thing, it's very exciting to know it's on its way.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you think the new concepts will bring new mappers out of the woodwork?
</strong><br />krusch: You know, I think they probably will. There'll be a lot of new room for experimentation, which will also bring the oldish mappers who don't much know what to do in Ned anymore(kinda like me), out of hiding. I'm hoping, at least.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: You've been noted, not only as a mapmaker, but as a great all-around artist. This is most obviously seen in your signature on the forums which currently contains a bizarre mutation of a Pokemon. What's with that?
</strong><br />krusch: Oh, hahaha. That is a ""New Lickitung Evo"" which I edited in over my old sig (with real Lickitung). My old sig was just a screenshot of mIRC with an emulator over the top. I was smashing the rocks outside of Mauville, if I recall correctly.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do other people ask you what the hell it's supposed to be or is this common knowledge?
</strong><br />krusch: Haha. You're the first to ask actually, I assume people just assume it's ... well, I don't know. A kid on <a href=""http://www.smogon.com/forums/"">Smogon</a> posted this <a href=""http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=12628"">thread</a>. That's where the crazy image comes from, anyway.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: You and <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/KinGAleX""><em>KinGAleX</em></a> coordinate quite often on projects. Are you two, you know, an item?
</strong><br />krusch: Yes. Actually, no. But, y'know. :,(
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you have any New Years resolutions planned?
</strong><br />krusch: Nah. I'll probably just resolve to resolve make sure I always treat everyone equally. Sometimes I don't, and it makes me very annoyed with myself. But uhh, yeah, that's my problem. Not anyone else's to worry about. Have you?
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Oh! Umm, to make this year's edition of Nterviewed to be the best ever!
</strong><br />krusch: Rad.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Heh heh. One last question: Do you prefer fresh or dried apricots?
</strong><br />krusch: I prefer 'em fresh. But I do like a dry every now and then.
</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Well, krusch, it has been a pleasure. Thank you for joining us tonight.
</strong><br />krusch: Definitely pleasurable, yeah. Good luck with next week! I'm sure it'll be at least as good as this was.
</p><br /><p>
Next week's Nterviewee will remain a secret until the Nterview is published. Ooooo. Mysterious.</p>"

<h2>A Somewhat Sizeable Rectification</h2>
<p>It was brought to my attention early this week that I did not actually write a news article here for <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=14302"">the two-column-taster</a> <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sendy""><em>Sendy</em></a> released for her upcoming map pack. It was an honest mistake, and I hope this message will revitalise all of you to go play it some more!</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>There were a fair few Legacy announcements this week, including the culmination of <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15006"">The Dronies</a>, the long-awaited release of their second map pack, <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=14886"">Expanse</a>, and the start of the <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=14890"">Monday Night Numa Map League</a>. Also, inducted into the Legacy ranks were <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/blue_tetris""><em>Dave</em></a>, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch""><em>krusch</em></a>, and <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/KinGAleX""><em>I</em></a>.

<p>When <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy""><em>Kablizzy</em></a> first agreed to be <em>Nterviewed</em>, I have to admit that I may have been a little starstruck. I mean, this is <em>Kablizzy</em> we're talking about. This dude is infamous. But as infamous as he is, he's also very easy to talk with.</p>

<p>Also, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/LittleViking001""><em>LittleViking</em></a> helped me overcome my block this week by contributing a couple of questions. Special thanks goes out to him.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Greetings and salutations, fellow Metanuts, and welcome to <em>Nterviewed</em>. Tonight, we have the ineffably cool Kablizzy with us. How are ya, mate?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: I'm just fine, thanks. And you?</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: I'm quite well. You are one of the most prominent figures in the Metanet community thanks in part to your longevity and in part to your activity. Back when you joined, N was not as widespread. How did you find it initially?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Actually, a friend introduced me to the game back in April of 2004, and after a few days of playing, I ended up forgetting about it, but I didn't join the community until I found NUMA and began using NED and playing the game more devoutly.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: How is this community special to you or different from other communities?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: There are a lot of ways, actually. For some reason, Metanet tends to attract a different type of gamer than most communities do, or if we do attract a certain type of gamer, it seems as though the community gives them a chance to evolve and mature, both as gamers, and as people in general. I feel as though each person brings something special to the community, in their own way. Beyond that, though, N is an unbelievable product, and I can't help but feel proud that I work for <a href=""http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/about.html""><em>Raigan and Mare</em></a> as I do. It's truly an honour to be able to volunteer to make Metanet more successful.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: What do you think is your primary role in the community?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Primarily, to provide a positive and flavourful environment for those who are interested in N, and in Metanet. Above all else, I am here for the community, as a portal for concerns and suggestions and to help give a fun and entertaining atmosphere. There are a lot of nuances to what I do, but more than anything, I believe people see me as a Patriarch, of sorts, and I seem to have slid into that role well. A lot of my job, though, is just to keep things in order and running smoothly, and to promote what Mare and Raigan do best, and to make sure that they, as a company, come across well to those who are interested.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: What's it been like administrating the forum for so long? Do you have a different attitude towards being a moderator/admin now than when you first become one?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Very much so. My moderator spot here was my first ever, and since I joined here, I've been a moderator at a number of other forums, as well as a number of other websites, so in my time here and at the other sites, I feel as though I've evolved - Not only as a mod, but as a person, too. Looking back, though, it's a lot less prestigious than I had imagined it to be. There's a lot more grunt work, and there's a lot more responsibility that comes with being an Administrator. Being a moderator doesn't come with as much of an investment as being an Admin does, since as an Admin, everyone looks up to you for decisions... So, being an Administrator has its upside and downside, really. It's amazingly fun, though.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Have you noticed a change in the community since you joined?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Mmm... Kinda yes and kinda no. I chalk some of the change up to my perception of the community when I first joined, it was all brand-new and shiny, but from this side of the fence, the things that used to amaze me now are just a part of the everyday operation. Beyond that, though, the userbase has grown so much that there are a ton of new personalities, and so many great ideas and contributions from everyone... I never could have imagined that the community would flourish this well. In fact, I remember a time, before we were moderators, when LittleViking and I were the only two members on the forums at night, and our only communication between each other was via Personal Message. Now we have so many different modes of communication, I think it's brought the community closer as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Do you have a favorite community project that is currently active and that you aren't involved in as leadership or counsel?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Oh, wow. There are so many, I don't think I could pick one out of the mix. The <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=11987"">Ten Minute Map Ladder Tournament</a> was an awesome idea, <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=13957"">InsomNicon</a> was amazing, I love the <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=14085"">mp3 station</a>, but really, every contribution to the community has been great. I almost feel bad mentioning those three, since there are so many great contributions out there. All in all, I would love to see more from the community in the future, that's for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: I had to qualify that last question because you are personally involved in so many things. Most notably, the <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showforum=39"">Legacy Project</a> recently released <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=14886"">Legacy: Expanse</a>. What does it look like to put together and organize something like Legacy in almost total secrecy?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: It takes an amazing amount of work, and particularly before Legacy's Origins release, we had to keep everything in complete secrecy, which was amazing to me, since we had even made an IRC channel named #Legacy, I'm shocked that people didn't put two and two together that something bigger was going down. Of course, things have been a tad bumpy at times, and we're currently dealing with quite a bit of inactivity, due to everyone's real lives, but somehow, we all come together in the end to pull things off. I'm really looking forward to all that we have planned in 2007, it's looking to be a big, big year for Metanet as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Can you spare any tidbits of what's coming up as an exclusive or are you really that much of an information Scrooge?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: About Metanet? Well, nothing there that I can spare without getting fired, but let's just say that <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=4284"">v1.5</a> and <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=11578"">Robotology</a> aren't the only things on the horizon. Insofar as Legacy? It's not much of a spoiler, but we're expecting to release a third map pack in the Legacy series, which will be entitled ""Zenith"". Beyond that, <a href=""http://therealn.com/"">The Real N</a> had fallen a bit by the wayside towards the end of the year, so things there will pick up quite a bit, and we are all trying to reorganize Legacy's projects and welcome <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/blue_tetris""><em>Dave</em></a>, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/KinGAleX""><em>KinGAleX</em></a>, and <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch""><em>krusch</em></a> into the mix as well.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Speaking of which, you wrote an article for The Real N entitled ""It's Your Legacy"" that was a big part of my inspiration to start Nterviewed. Your articles, in general, are a fascinating read. Any ideas on what you might write about next?<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Heh, thank you. I have a .txt file with somewhere around 1000 topics in it that I could write on, but time constraints and lack of motivation really hinder my progress as a writer. In fact, I hope to be a professional writer someday, it's just a matter of being able to sit down and write for an extended period of time. So, I'd expect more articles from me in the future, but most of the articles that I write are either immediately pertinent to what's going on in my life, or something very abstract and train-of-thought.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Well, that about wraps it up. Thanks for being here tonight, Kablizzy.<br /></strong>
Kablizzy: Excellent, Thanks for having me. It was an amazing experience, and I hope we can do this again.</p>

<br />
<p>Next week, the always insightful <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sweep""><em>Sweep</em></a> will be joining us to recap what's happening with NUMA and to give us a retrospective on the Dronies amongst other things. You will have been looking forward to it.</p>"

<h2>January 7th</h2>
<p>Well, I guess it isn't a surprise anymore that I consider <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/lord_day""><em>lord_day</em></a> one of the best contemporary mapmakers, and so you should be ready to play some of his maps whenever this is released. <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/75184"">This particular one</a> is no exception.</p>
<h2>January 8th</h2>
<p>If you don't think <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/75226"">this map</a>, by <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch"">my main man</a>, isn't gorgeous, I don't know what the hell's wrong with you.</p>

<p>I know you don't like to see nothing for a day, but I have to stick by my principle that I'm showing you what I think deserves to be shown, not just telling myself something's better than it is to fill up some space. So maybe I'll start filling these spaces with interesting facts.</p>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Level Packs</h2>
<p>For the first time in seven issues, there has passed a week with no level pack releases. I think that I should give a huge shoutout to a community that can make this much user-created content, of a high enough standard for me to talk about, for a month and a goddamn half. Y'all deserve a pat on the back. Nice shit.</p>

<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>

<p>This week's Nterviewee is crazy. He's involved in sooooo much stuff. I won't even bother to name everything because by the time I'd finished naming them all, he'd probably have started something new. Yeah. <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15042"">Metasecret</a> is a very neat idea that just didn't make it into this interview. You should still check it out.</p>
<p><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sweep""><em>Sweep</em></a> and I tried really hard this week to get in touch with each other through IRC. Unfortunately, due to conflicting schedules and timezones, it never quite worked out. But the show must go on! Here we have the first <em>Nterviewed</em> done completely in Private Message. Think of it as a shout-out to what <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy""><em>Kablizzy</em></a> was talking about last week.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: What has changed with <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/"">NUMA</a> in the past three weeks since the maestro interview?
</strong><br />Sweep: We've created a carbon copy of NUMA where all the members are robots. We've configured them to be incredible at map-making but not bothered at all by ratings. It's worked. There's no multiaccounting.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Were you pleased with the reaction to <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=14886"">Expanse</a>?
</strong><br />Sweep: Honestly? I was partly chuffed and partly a bit depressed by it. Like all level-packs, it often feels like the response is dwarfed by the magnitude of the pack in the first place. The people that do respond about the quality of the pack were the people that made me really happy - because they had great things to say. But I almost expected something more.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Have you finished all the levels in Expanse? Did you get to play them all before they came out?
</strong><br />Sweep: Ha! The notion of me completing Expanse is really quite funny. I have played every single level, of course. That's what it's all about.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Were you happy with how <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15006http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15006"">the Dronies</a> turned out?
</strong><br />Sweep: Absolutely ecstatic. Over 100 voters! I mean, 2006 Dronies totally screwed over 2005 Dronies. And <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15006"">the results</a> were mostly ""correct"" in my opinion. Not that I don't disagree with the way the odd thing turned out. But hey, who am I to speak for the community as a whole? That's why it works, because who wins is, at the end of the day, completely down the community.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Were you surprised to win the Mare &amp; Raigan Award for Contribution to the Community?
</strong><br />Sweep: Yes. I hadn't really thought about it at all until I listened to <a href=""http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/dronies_2006_final.mp3"">the mp3</a> for the first time, and as they built up to revealing the winner, the thought entered my mind of ""hey, I could win"". But it was nothing more than a fleeting thought. I figured Keron or Kablizzy would end up with it. It was slightly surreal when they said my name - not only my name, but my actual real life name. I'm getting quite good at these awards ceremonies. At the last one I was at, back in November, I swept up six awards... my ego is already big enough as it is. This isn't helping.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you have any advice to offer to people who want to contribute to the community but don't know how?
</strong><br />Sweep: I'd say there are three main ways. The first is by just being a good member of the community. Be nice to people, help people make better maps. Don't multi-account. Don't complain all the time. Be happy and positive. Alternatively, you can be a great community member by just being incredibly helpful. If you can, give some time to the <a href=""http://n.wikicities.com/"">N Wiki</a>... or if you think you have some wicked coding skills that could benefit NUMA, why not send us an email? We can't guarantee anything, but if you feel you have something to give, then don't hide it.
The third way is the one which I occupy - just coming up with ways to improve the community. And, if possible, implementing them. This approach suits me personally, because I have a stupidly active imagination. You wouldn't want to spend a day in my head - you'd just end up with a headache.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Are you planning any changes for <a href=""http://www.madnesstemple.com/bite/"">bitesizeNUMA</a> or your other projects?
</strong><br />Sweep: Well, bitesizeNUMA is essentially going to be integrated right into NUMA. There won't really be a bitesizeNUMA anymore, the reality is that it'll be more like there's a new category on NUMA for bitesized maps. Elsewhere, with other projects (both in and outside the community), there are exciting things afoot. But since I have 4 A Level exams in the upcoming week, don't expect anything tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: What inspired <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/37144"">Rocket Rocket Revolution</a>?
</strong><br />Sweep: Originally, the whole thing came about a long, long time ago. At the time I was essentially idolizing <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Lucidium""><em>Lucidium</em></a> and all the incredible innovation that you could find in his levels. I was trying to come up with the most lateral, out-there innovation possible... we all know you can do crazy stuff with the way enemies interact with N, and we all know that you can make N do things that you wouldn't expect - like cheating one-ways and teleporting from one side of the screen to the other. That was all <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=931"">old news</a>. The next logical step? Changing the object you're controlling. This was, as far as I know, a progression further from any innovations before. Luckily, at the time, Lucidium helped me realise the concept with his skill with making teleporters. After two or three incarnations, which didn't quite work out, it required the simple inspiration of the direction symbols from Dance Dance Revolution to make it a complete and successful concept. Not that I've even played Dance Dance Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: What is your greatest hope or vision for Metanet and the community?
</strong><br />Sweep: For all of us to co-exist in peace.</p>

<br /><p>Thanks again to <em>Sweep</em> for letting us pick his brain. Next week, I will have the pleasure of chatting with <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Red_Reamer""><em>Kashkin/Red Reamer</em></a>. He doesn't know this yet, but I'm planning to refer to him as <em>Kashiekins</em> throughout the entire interview.</p>"

<h2>The Multi-Accounters</h2>
<p>
Alright, so I skipped out on this last week, 'cause reports were still
coming in. Recently, an admittance by <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/dejablue4""><em>dejablue</em></a> that
he was a multi-accounter, and rated up his own maps, spurred a large
number of other users to admit, and a fair few more to be found out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all those who confessed: <a

sit down and put in your vote. <em>Sweep</em> wants to hit one hundred
votes this year, and I think we can do it.</p>
<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>
<p><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/maestro""><em>maestro</em></a> is a web designer, prominent
member of the Metanet community and kind enough to agree to be the
first person to appear on <em>Nterviewed</em>. Not only is this the
first installment of <em>Nterviewed</em>, it will also be marketed as
the Christmas edition in order to cash in on the hype. Enjoy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner: Welcome to the very first edition of <i>Nterviewed</i>.
Tonight, we have the special treat of grilling maestro like the hot
piece of meat he is. </strong><br />
maestro: Oh, am I ever. The best meat's in the rump. <br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner: So, maestro, these are pretty exciting times for the Metanet
community and especially for you because you are involved in so much of
the current projects. </strong><br />
maestro: Yeah. Although I'm not involved in much apart from <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net"">NUMA</a>. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Can you tell us what some of your hopes are for NUMA? </strong><br />
maestro: At the moment it's very... One-dimensional, basically. People
submit maps, people rate &amp; comment on maps. There's no cohesion.
We're wanting to broaden the possibilities within NUMA. And of course
stamping out voting abuse. With a revamped voting system it should be
very easy. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you have any fears about how the new system will turn out
or be used?</strong><br />
maestro: Fears, no. It can't be worse than it currently is, put it that
way. NUMA was absolutely not designed with abuse in mind, so it's very
vulnerable. You can deal with a lot of that if you have defensive
measures in place from the start. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Are you finding the suggestions from the community helpful? </strong><br />
maestro: Yeah, it's great. It's nice to have them all there to look
through. Many of them we've already thought of. Don't PM me with them
though, please. It's not that urgent unless there's a serious issue
that needs fixing. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: On this project, you are working with </strong><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sweep""><em>Sweep</em></a><strong> and, to some degree, </strong><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Arachnid""><em>Arachnid</em></a><strong>. Do you find that you make a
good team? </strong><br />
maestro: Good team, I think so. <em>Sweep</em>'s got great ideas. And we
agree a lot. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: One of your more famous (or infamous) maps on NUMA is called <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/46742"">Shine</a>. Care to tell us a bit about
that, what it is and where it came from? </strong><br />
maestro: Hahaha. Yeah, people got really riled up about that. And many
people seem to think that's basically all I've done, which is a bit of
a shame. I make plenty of serious maps I think are pretty good. I just
fiddle around a lot as well. Now, what is it? Basically, I wanted to
get the best ratio of rating to map content. Later on I decided it's a
bit of a tribute to the complexity of the game that is belied by its
simplicity. 47 people have rated it, you know. An average of 3.5.
That's impressive as far as I'm concerned. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Lots of people thought it was just an inside joke.</strong> <br />
maestro: Inside to what? No-one was actually 'in' on it. <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/46737"">#loungelizards</a></em> was a bit more of an inside joke.
(side note: '<em>We Are The Winners</em>', Lithuania's Eurovision 2006
entry, just started playing on my media player) </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: You were the driving force behind the creation of the </strong><strong><a
 href=""http://n.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"">N wiki</a></strong><strong> a while back. Are you
satisfied with what it has become and how it is progressing? </strong><br />
maestro: I always thought we needed a wiki. It's alright. Progressing
sporadically. Better than nothing, though. Way better. There's quite a
bit of content there. <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/tktktk""><em>tktktk</em></a> started a drive a while ago to
get people making some contributions. I think a lot of the editing is
driven by ego. Sooo many edits of personal pages. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: <a href=""http://www.maestrosync.com/nehs/"">NEHS</a> used to be the darling of the
projects that the community was working on. What happened to the N
Episode Help Site? </strong><br />
maestro: Wasn't it just <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Maniak""><em>Maniac</em></a>? It died when <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/trib4lmaniac"">trib4l</a></em>'s site went down. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: I think so. But you mirrored it.</strong> <br />
maestro: Yeah. But as it happened I had downloaded a copy of it before
it went down. So I stuck it up on my host, and now there's the wiki
people can come and transcribe. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: As well as being involved in Metanet, you also have <a
 href=""http://maestrosync.com"">your personal site</a> that houses a blog and the
occasional N reference. Do you have any advice for up-and-coming web
design enthusiasts? </strong><br />
maestro: Certainly. #1, don't use Frontpage. Oh, #0, don't use Word.
#2, it's probably best not to use Dreamweaver's WYSIWYG also. And don't
use &lt;font&gt; tags or tables for layout. <a
 href=""http://www.alistapart.com"">www.alistapart.com</a> is an awesome website. It's for
web developer types, and it's full of great articles. They've got a
couple of summaries for beginners as well. I can't advise about
learning the basics, because I'm not sure how I did. Looking at the
HTML source of other websites, I think. And also looking at the
official specifications at <a href=""http://www.w3.org"">www.w3.org</a>. Web design is a lot of fun.
Everyone ought to give it a shot. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Over a month ago, you announced that you would be working on
a multiplayer strategy game called <em><a
 href=""http://www.maestrosync.com/2006/11/territory-announcement-of-new-development-for-make-benefit-glorious-readers-of-weblog/"">Territory</a></em>
 and since then all we've seen
is <a href=""http://www.maestrosync.com/2006/12/territory-preview-2/"">a
frustratingly vague screenshot</a>. Why must you tease us? </strong><br />
maestro: Heheh. I don't mean to tease. Have I said anything about what
it's about? Not really, I suppose. I'm working quite steadily on it
(NUMA has been quite a distraction). I think the reason I've been very
vague is, well, firstly to build up hype (ha!), and also because I'm
not so sure how I could summarise it. The current description in the
HTML for it is ""Territory is a free browser-based online turn-based
multiplayer strategy game with a simple concept and simple rules
(simpler than that sentence)."" Apart from that all I've got is a Word
document full of notes and ideas. All I've got in terms of description,
that is. Oh, oh. ""The game is all about having territory. The more you
have, the better you are (and the more your parents love you)."" And
""The real game is in diplomacy."" I'll reveal more in due course! I'm
also working on a redesign of said site. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: You're going to sexy up <a
 href=""http://www.maestrosync.com"">maestrosync.com</a>?</strong><br />
maestro: Yes. Sex it up like a dossier. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Alright! I think that's a good note to wrap it up on. </strong><br />
maestro: What on earth was with that saying, by the way. Dodgy,
sexed-up dossiers. </p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Thanks for being my first victim, maestro. </strong><br />
maestro: Thanks for having me in this here interview channel. </p><br /><p>
Next week's installment of <em>Nterviewed</em> will feature the
singularly attractive <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch""><em>krusch</em></a> who has promised to be both
arousing and informative. Don't miss it.</p>"

<i><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Clifty"">Clifty</a></i>, a
relatively new mapmaker from Australia, brought out <a

acclaim. His DDAs are quite possibly the most heralded of any new
author's. Watch out for his stuff!<br>

<i><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/BuddyLee"">BuddyLee</a></i>'s
weekly map, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70154"">Mezzanine</a>,
looks to be one of the best maps of the week. This well-structured map,
complete with a superb demo is well worth your looking at.<br>
<br>
Early in the day, <i><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sendy"">Sendy</a></i>
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70153"">released</a> <a

five votes.<br>
<br>
One of our resident writers, <i><a

off his new series with <i><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70126"">Damn

be based on famous movies, and scenes and quotes from them. <i>Dave</i><a

Interestingly, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70249"">two maps</a>
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70254"">were posted</a> which
reminded me almost totally of another author. These two homages, to <i><a

One of the most readily apparent trends, that of small minefields used
to block off sections of the map, has been shown by many of the current
trendy mapmakers. Examples <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70237"">here</a>,
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70254"">here</a>, <a

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70264"">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Also ridiculously stylish currently is the use of blocky tilesets,
usually with lots of open space. Examples <a

I'm not sure whether it can be classified as a trend within mapmaking
itself, but at least within <a

I'm seeing a lot of one ways used for rather obscure purposes, and
trails of mines. Examples <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/70813"">here</a>

I sat down with <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Mr_Mongoose""><i>Mr_M</i></a>
in the IRC this week, and we had a chat about the upcoming map pack <i>Idomneous</i>,
for which he is both a mapmaker and co-leader. He gave me a few details
for you all to suss out, and hopefully look forward to. It is an
episodic map pack, hopefully to be released by the end of the year
(perhaps as a Christmas present, he added), chiefly mapped by <i>Mr_M</i>
and <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/spiker5""><i>Spiker</i></a>,

the lack of content. During those three days when NUMA was either down

week. I hope you enjoy it anyway.</p>

<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>

<p>""Given my predecessors, I
feel I should be involved in 2 dozen projects."" - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Red_Reamer""><em>Kashkin</em></a></p>
<p>I may have given the wrong impression about what <em>Nterviewed</em> is
about. Sure, a part of it is yours. If you'd like to say something
important, hit me up and I will do my best to help you out. But most of
it is mine. This is me, talking to people that I find interesting and
enjoyable. I enjoy this, probably more than you do. Kashkin didn't
think he really had that much to talk about but he was dead wrong.
Check this dude out.</p>
<p><strong>Tanner: How did you choose the aliases you go by? Does the name <em>Red
Reamer</em> have a sexual insinuation?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Sigh. No, it does not have any sexual connotations. RR was
first and foremost my Xbox Live alias. I think I combined a few of the
randomly generated suggestions until I got Red Reamer. I've had... a
lot of aliases in the past. Knife &amp; a Half, The Ill Nar Nar,
Inanimate, Aramanthster, shgoaghoiag... I'm happy I've found something
that's stuck. <em>Kashkin</em> is a by-product of my past infatuation
with Russia and the Russian language. Basically I wanted a name that
sounded Russian.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Are you planing anything exciting for the next little while?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Well, the most exciting thing by far is the upcoming map-pack
I&#8217;ve headed, due to be released on the 25th. It's codenamed ASF, and
includes some of my favourite map-makers. The main contributors are <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Aju""><em>Aju</em></a>, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/astheoceanblue""><em>astheoceansblue</em></a>,
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Barabajagal""><em>Barabajagal</em></a>,
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Clovic""><em>Clovic</em></a>, and of course, myself. There are
also some special guests (*wink*), including <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/spect""><em>spect</em></a>, who makes his debut in a
map-pack.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: What was your thought process behind beginning a map pack?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Mostly, I felt like I could. Prior to ASF, I was semi-retired
as a map-maker, due to lack of ""creative juice."" And now I have, in the
words of <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/KinGAleX""><em>KinGAleX</em></a>,
""Enough map sperm in the scrotal sacs of creativity."" Essentially, ASF
is a non-episodic collection that brought together a bunch of people I
enjoy talking to and working with.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: What do you see as being your primary role in the community?</strong><br />
Kashiekins: Well, for the last few months, I&#8217;ve been rather focused on
imaging. I'm not active in any of the big projects, or in NUMA. I made
a joke recently that I should be the community&#8217;s ""Artistic Director.""
The responses were either laughter or silence, so I'm probably still
hampered by my complete lack of artistic talent (Photoshopping is not
the same). I'm not even ""that guy that always agrees with <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/blue_tetris""><em>Dave</em></a>"" anymore. I'll settle for being a
... Slutiopath. Or whatever.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Why did you make a <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15163"">new
forum skin</a></strong><strong>?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Why not? I saw a few tutorials on the subject, and figured we
could use a new look. Really though, there was no primary motivator. I
just did it. Thanks to the co-operation of <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/jtbandes""><em>jtbandes</em></a> and <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Pembie""><em>Pembie</em></a>,
of course with input from Keron Cyst, there's a good chance the skin
will be implemented, but I'll leave all that for a later date (i.e.
When it happens :P ).</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Where do you find most of the pictures you use to create
your images?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Google-image search. Where else? Your <a
 href=""http://img161.imageshack.us/img161/6876/rennatwy9.png"">panda</a>
is from <a href=""http://www.weebls-stuff.com/"">weebls-stuff</a>, of course. Some of the stuff I
make myself, usually via a tutorial on the subject.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: How much time to you normally spend on making an image?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Depends. On whom the image is for, the mood I'm in, how
interesting the request itself is and whether my first draft is any
good. I have a strange form of patience concerning projects that others
might consider mind-numbingly boring. So, generally more than 30
minutes and anywhere up to 3 hours or more. On average, probably 40
minutes. Do you remember the <a
 href=""http://www.kashkin.net/untitledepic/"">Untitled Epic</a>, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/LittleViking001""><em>LittleViking</em></a>'s ASCII story? I spent a day on
that project. Literally, about 14 hours.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you have any advice for someone who wants to experiment
with making images?</strong><br />
Kashkin: Tutorials and patience. That is essentially how I got to be
where I am (where ever that is). I'm not particularly gifted, but I do
have an inordinate amount of patience.</p><p>
<strong>Tanner: Which song would you most enjoy making love to?</strong><br />
Kashkin: It amuses me that this is not even the third or fourth time
I&#8217;ve had this conversation. I used to say <a
 href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=216"">Stellar</a> by <a
 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus_%28band%29"">Incubus</a>,
and I would &#8211;still&#8211; enjoy that, especially the acoustic version.
Perhaps even <a
 href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858502561"">To
Be Alone With You</a> by <a
 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens"">Sufjan Stevens</a>.
Ultimately though, I&#8217;m going to have to take sides with both the song <a
 href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858486960"">Let&#8217;s
Play Guitar in a Five Guitar Band</a> by <a
 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_the_Bear"">Minus the Bear</a>
and my Canadian friend Vanessa; Jazz. She suggested <a
 href=""http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/runawaybride/itneverenteredmymind.htm"">It
Never Entered My Mind</a> by <a
 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis"">Miles Davis</a>, which
I think is particularly sexy (the suggestion and as a result, Vanessa).
So that, or something from the album <a
 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue"">Kind of Blue</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>See? Next week will be a little different. <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Borealis""><em>Borealis</em></a> and <em><a

Introducing the <em>VeNterview</em>! <a

do the interview this week and I think it turned out pretty well. The
questions are included but you'll have to download the file to hear the
answers.</p>

<p><strong>How did you first find N?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What's it been like to witness the evolution of the Metanet Community
almost since its conception?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think that most people in the Metanet Community have a pretty
good idea of who you are?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you really know a lot more about what's planned for future Metanet
projects than most members of the community?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy""><em>Kablizzy</em></a> <a

that I work for Raigan and Mare as I do."" Do you see this as work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you ever tire of life in the spotlight?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What inspired the creation of <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=2542"">The Youth
and Beauty Brigade</a> and the ensuing forum riddle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there a certain time of day or day of the week when you make the
most maps?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think it's accurate to describe <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch""><em>krusch</em></a> as ""a younger, more
post-modern <em>LittleViking001</em>.""</strong></p>
<p><strong>What's happening with <a

<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/spect""><em>spect</em></a> has
always been one of my favourite highscorers. He does some of the most
precise runs you've ever seen. Aside from that, he's a dude of quite a
lot of other skills. He's one of the few native German-speakers on the
forums, actively participates in the <a
 href=""irc://irc.waypasteleven.com/n"">#n</a> IRC and has a few other
projects going on.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner: Post-Valentine's, we have the pleasure of being joined by
spect for this issue of <em>Nterviewed</em>. How are you <em>spect</em>?</strong><br />
spect: Hey hey! I'm fine, I guess.<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: You are currently in charge of running the <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15821"">NTTS</a></strong><strong>.
How did it come about that you took charge of it from <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Daddaluma""><em>Daddaluma</em></a></strong><strong>?</strong><br />
spect: I don't really remember exactly. I think I just felt like
running a highscoring contest as there hadn't been any highscoring
contests back then. I just thought something was missing so I started a
thread, asking if anyone was interested, and indeed, people loved the
idea :) The early bird catches the worm, anyone could've had done that,
I think.<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: How was this year's NTTS different from last year's?</strong><br />
spect: The most obvious difference is that we (the judges) are not
using maps from one specific levelpack, rather than choosing the maps
ourselves from all available levelpacks. Furthermore, Style and Time
are both separated, so there will be a winner in Style and Time. And...
I think I'm lazier than last Season so my judging is taking even longer
than usually ;)<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: Are you going to continue running the NTTS? If so, are you
planning any changes for the future?</strong><br />
spect: I'm quite sure I will continue running the NTTS, yes. And yeah,
I guess there will be changes in the future.<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: What's it like being part of a community where the official
language isn't your native one?</strong><br />
spect: It's fun :) Seriously, you can't imagine how proud I feel when
some people are writing ""should of"" or ""your"" instead of ""you're"". I
really improved my English a lot here. And by now, it's not really a
problem to write in English for me, it's almost like a native language
to me now. You might notice that I'm taking quite long to answer your
questions, though, and my pronunciation isn't getting any better by
typing, either :P<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: You used to make pretty impressive highscores. Why did you
stop?</strong><br />
spect: Many reasons: The first one was probably that people (<a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/naem""><em>naem</em></a>, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/jg9000""><em>jg9000</em></a> ) started
taking my highscores (check 95-1 dude, it's THA BOMB!!) and I just
couldn't retake them. The competition was getting harder and harder,
and at some point, I think it was January or February 2006, I decided
to stop. Another thing was the whole <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=7561&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=199137"">cheating
affair</a> with <em>kryX</em> and <em>naem</em> and the whole highscoring
was getting more and more ridiculous. That's why I'm looking forward to
N 1.5, as it should have some anti-cheating features.<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: When you were highscoring, how did you pick which levels to
go for?</strong><br />
spect: The levels I chose were really random. The first 0th I got was
on 80-3 (worth watching, although the route now is totally different
than it was back then). Then I went for levels in the 70-column,
because they were easy and fun (75-4 is a nice example of my
abilities). At one point though, I started going through the game and
taking every level I could. I ended up with having 80 0ths :)<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: Do you have any advice for players who want to be better at
highscoring?</strong><br />
spect: Nope, actually not. Just play the game. Practice (playing more)
will surely help you, but I can't guarantee anything.<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: How would you sum up your reaction on being voted ""Best
Nipples"" in <em>Obby</em>'s <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15139"">elections</a></strong><strong>?</strong><br />
spect: Woot!<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: Haha. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUbftO4PYs"">You
solve</a></strong><strong> a damned fine Rubik's Cube. Who first taught you to do
them?</strong><br />
spect: [Warning! Anti-climax!] I.... did it myself :/ Really, I just
read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_cube"">the
wikipedia article</a>...<p></p>
<strong>Tanner: Alright. Thanks for your time, <em>spect</em>.</strong><br />
spect: Thank you.<p></p>

encouraged me to run with it. He even offered to host it on his <i>The
Sunday N</i> publication before he knew anything about it besides the
premise. It was a huge leap of faith that got my idea off the ground.
Well, more or less. I still only had a vague outline of what it was
going to look like and no clue who I was going to interview. <br>
<br>
This was around the end of December and the thing that weighed most
heavily on my mind was the new ownership of NUMA. Namely, </font><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/maestro""><i>maestro</i></a> and <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sweep""><i>Sweep</i></a><font
 face=""Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"">. And since I was in contact with
the former more often than the latter, I decided to see if he was up
for a little chat. I'm still surprised to this day that that first
interview went down as well as it did. Neither of us really knew what
we were doing and yet I'm still really pleased with it. <br>
<br>
I tried to model the <i>Nterviewed</i> structure after what I know of
real interviews. I'm a pretty big fan of talk radio and my mother is a
radio DJ so it wasn't as though I hadn't had enough exposure. Every
interview starts with research. I like to ask the interviewee if there
is anything they would like to talk about and promote and then I look
into the corresponding forum thread and put together a few questions.
Otherwise, the </font><a href=""http://n.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"">N
Wiki</a><font face=""Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif""> generally serves as
a good jumping off point.<br>
<br>
The comes the actual conversation. I prefer to do the interviews via
the IRC so as to more closely mimic a real conversation but just PMing
the questions serves in a pinch. After that, it's just a matter of
copying and pasting the text into a new </font><a
 href=""http://docs.google.com/"">Google docs</a><font
 face=""Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif""> file, changing the format, adding
some links and sending it to Alex. A <i>VeNterview</i> takes a little
more time than that, though. The entire conversation is recorded using </font><a
 href=""http://www.ventrilo.com/"">Ventrilo</a><font
 face=""Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif""> and then edited using </font><a
 href=""http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"">Audacity</a><font
 face=""Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"">. <br>
<br>
That's basically it. Your regularly scheduled programming will return
next week.<br>

<h2>Level Packs</h2>
<p>Sorry guys, I accidentally left <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=15525"">this one</a> out last week! Apologies to all involved!</p>
<p>This guy's name pings me on the IRC. <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=16199&hl="">Grr</a>.</p>
<p>have heard good things about <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=16214&hl="">this one</a>. Therefore, I recommend it!</p>
<p>Where will <em>you</em> be at <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=16253&hl=""><strong>Twilight</strong></a>?</p>
<p>Fuck a duck, <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=16252"">E.</a> is definitely the best thing since sliced bread. It shits all over sliced bread. Great work, guys.</p>

<h1>KinGAleX's Top Ten Maps of Ever!</h1>
<p>Note that these are my top ten NUMA maps. No maps from map packs were included.</p>
<p>Countdown kawaii &#252;ber start now!</p>
<h3>#10: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Aju"">Aju</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/58238"">Clanker's Cavern</a></h3>
<p>Regardless of the fact that Ju-Ju can't spell 'sequel', this map is a rocker. The drones are just superb, coming in and out at the right times, and the difficulty is amazingly constantly hard throughout. Well done, and have a gold star, Aju!</p>

<h3>#9: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/formica"">formica</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/50330"">No two ways about it</a></h3>
<p>Definitely my favourite 'straight puzzle', if you will. I honestly did not stop playing this map for one second until I completed it, when it was released.</p>

<h3>#8: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Templex"">Templex</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/12248"">Twig</a></h3>
<p>Ahh, damn. I feel so old loving this map. It's such a long time ago, now, and such a fantastic map, especially for those times. Times are good, kids. Tell your kids that, yo.</p>

<h3>#7: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Andrelius"">Andrelius</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/11280"">Roots of all Evil</a></h3>
<p>Andrelius has fallen into obscurity, unfortunately. He was a dude who used to hang out with me late at night in the ol' IRC. This map was insanely good. I urge you all to play it.</p>

<h3>#6: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/jeffkillian"">jeffkillian</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/7575"">Desperado</a></h3>
<p>Why don't <em>you</em> come to your senses? I remember this feller as the very first user-made level I ever played. Fuck I thought it was hard. Now I think it's relatively easy. Still the best freeform Action map around, bitches.</p>

<h3>#5: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch"">krusch</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/30248"">Domo-kun FTW!</a></h3>
<p>This map is ... just amazing. I don't know what to say about it. ^^</p>

<h3>#4: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Aju"">blue_tetris</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/10835"">Minaus Maezum</a></h3>
<p>Talk about nostalgic maps. I remember spending a long time demoing this one. Boy-o boy-o boy-o Dave makes the coolest thwump maps.</p>

<h3>#3: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch"">krusch</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/34104"">Scandalier</a></h3>
<p>It is becoming increasingly hard to say things about these maps, because they are just pure perfection. It was so hard to even differentiate between these top maps! Grah. I love krusch maps!</p>

<h3>#2: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/lord_day"">lord_day</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/64991"">The Death of Suspense</a></h3>
<p>Yeah. I know at least ten of you were sitting there, snug in your chairs, going, ""Oh yeah, one of these next two is <em>totally</em> going to be a lord_day map. Totally!"" Yeah, well FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU IN THE ASS.</p>

<h3>#1: <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/AMomentLikeThis"">AMomentLikeThis</em> - <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/49490"">Poetically Pathetic</a></h3>
<p>Yeah. Didn't pick <em>this</em> one, did you? I have had so much fun with this map. Love love love!</p>

<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rennaT"">Tanner Rogalsky</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Clovic""><em>Clovic</em></a>: the butt of so many in-jokes that it was difficult to come up with questions this week without referencing a whole bunch of stuff that a maximum of about eight people would fully understand. He used to be a moderator in a sub-forum of <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showforum=17"">Bash & Thrash</a> before the two were merged. He doesn't post that much on the forums anymore, but he's still fairly active on the IRC and Ventrilo. I'm dedicating this to his unborn child.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Are you ever going to finish your map pack?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: Wellll, I do plan on finishing it, but with school and work being in full motion right now it's a bit tough to find time to map.  I actually do have the majority of it done and am still waiting on several people to get their maps in, but yes, it will still be released.  When?  I can't really say, but it will come.   And it will be awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Why did you decide to do maps inspired by artists?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: To make maps I need inspiration and music is a very large portion of my life so not only does inspiration come but a chance to commemorate some of my favorites comes.  It's also fun to incorporate everyone elses favorites into it so we have kind of a top 10 list, but it's playable...If that makes sense. :/</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: What does that look like for you? Do you just listen to the music while you make a map or do you base on the album art or what?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: In all honesty it probably looks a lot different to me than most everyone else.  When I listen to music I can close my eyes and see it happening, or when I listen to different styles of music my brain does different things, it's sort of like that.  I just listen to the music, the transitions, the styles, the lyrics, and I get this picture in my mind and try my best to put it into the map.  It's pretty fun for me.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: How did you end up with your very own sub-forum?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: You bring up bad memories you do. :(  ---  The better question is why was my very own sub-forum taken away from my grasp!  I think it's probably something to do with...Hmmm that's a good question.  I'd like to know the answer too. :p</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: You have no page on the <a href=""http://n.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"">N Wiki</a> and yet you're a fairly prominent member of the community. What do you think that's about?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: Probably because I don't post all that often.  I stick to making maps, IRC, and vent, forums just get boring to me after a period of time so I've not been that much of an active poster.  That could be the reason I suppose.  I don't mind it though, I don't like being identified as anything in particular and if I had a page on the wiki surely people would identify me as certain things.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: You spent a bit of time as the top author on NUMA. Care to explain a bit about how that came to pass?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: In all honesty I think it came to pass because I was the best author for a time.  I mean, there were other circumstances, but I stayed there for an awful long time and why else would you make maps except to enjoy them and make the best ones you could make?  I don't think all that many people truly like my maps, but I think I'm one of the better ones out there. That may be conceited but if I thought I was crappy at making maps I wouldn't ever make em, so it's kind of a required thought process.</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Which games do you play besides N?</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: I play World of Warcraft and a TON of Guitar Hero.  I also never pass up a LAN party for Counter Strike and Unreal.  Anything on the new consoles are awesome as well, but I have not the funds to purchase one at the present time. :(</p>

<p><strong>Tanner: Take back what you said about myself not being able to conjure witty insults or suffer humiliation at the hands of a fabricated Nterviewed.</strong></p>
<p>Clovic: I honestly don't know what you're talking about, I was probably drunk. :p</p>

<br />

<p>Sure, <em>Clovic</em>! It was the alcohol talking! ;_; The forecast calls for a 99% chance of <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/blue_tetris""><em>blue_tetris</em></a> in the next seven days. You'll probably need galoshes.</p>"
15,"<p>As I explained in a comment on the last issue, I was
feeling fairly knackered on Sunday, and so left this issue 'til Monday.
If you can't handle that, get the fuck over it and read all those other
publications about NUMA. All of them.</p>
<p>On another more apologetic note, Tanner was unable to complete
Nterviewed this week, as his computer decided to up and be a fucking
whorefaced bitch. Look forward to his return some time in the near
future!</p>

Rundown<br />
April 22nd to April 28th</h1>
<h2>April 22nd</h2>
<p>I found <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86712"">this</a>
to be staggeredly orgasmic. How aboot you?</p>
<p>I didn't really expect <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86688"">this</a>
to be anything special until I played it. Seriously, try it out. You
may giggle.</p>
<p><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86683"">This</a> one's mine patterns
were influenced by me. I feel ultra-special. ^-^</p>
<p>Now <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86676"">this</a>. This is
something I'd never seen before. It even took me a couple of minutes to
work it out. Fantastic innovation.</p>
<p>Choose your <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86652"">path</a>. Or
die.</p>
<h2>April 23rd</h2>
<p>
This <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86820"">fellow</a> just felt
so good. I just want to hit that, over and over, and over a little more.</p>
<p>
Man. One might say I'm a <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86815"">sucker</a>
for linearity.</p>
<p>
As again exemplified through <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86797"">this</a>.
Amazingly open, yet lovelily closed.</p>
<h2>April 25th</h2>
<p>
I was told the <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/86961"">flower</a>
was for me. How pretty.</p>
<p>
You wanted innovations. Somehow, the community unbeknowingly <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/87046"">responded</a>!</p>
<p>
Seriously, guys, the innovation just keeps on coming. As do I, over the
greatness of <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/87040"">these maps</a>.</p>
<p>
Wow. I can't believe he ever finished <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/87035"">it</a>. The original
unfinished version was in my favourites, and so is this one. King of
Mine-Jumpers.</p>
<h2>April 28th</h2>
<p>
I didn't really find <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/87272"">it</a>
boring.</p>
<p>
Fantastic use of a tileset. Usually, everyone uses a tileset as a
gimmick. <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/87319"">This</a> one's
been done well!</p>

<h1>Artist
Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>
I suppose it would be pertinent for me to explain the purpose and
limitations of this new addition, so I shall.</p>
<p>
The general premise is for an author to take ten of their maps (from
NUMA or level packs) and provide a short explanation of say, why they
like the map, a cool story behind the map (or anything to do with the
map): basically whatever they find most interesting about these maps.
Of course, this means authors are encouraged to either choose their
favourite maps or ones with a particularly intriguing back story, but I
will place no limitation on which maps are chosen. Without further ado,
here's <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/yahoozy_Guacamole""><em>Yahoozy</em></a>'s
Commentary!</p>
<br />
<p>
<strong><a
 href=""http://www.therealn.com/nupb/paste.php?id=33"">The Maps Discussed</a></strong></p>
<p>
<em>Arctic Below</em>: Not necessarily my favourite, but what seems to be
my most successful. Unfortunately, I have a feeling this started the
&#8216;bounceblock bridge&#8217; fad. It&#8217;s a blast to play, nonetheless.</p>
<p>
<em>Barren</em>: Here is my first and only successful attempt at an
immoderately open map. Before mentioning it now, the last time I played
it was proximately around the time I unleashed it. I still find it
quite fun.</p>
<p>
<em>blue.</em>: This is the earliest of all the maps I&#8217;m mentioning. I
really like it. The end.</p>
<p>
<em>City Level</em>: The way you maneuver through this map is something I
truly venerate. The in-and-out movements are great, and making it your
choice to do so creates another whole level of game play.</p>
<p>
<em>Deep Sea Diver</em>: Extreme Sweep-age! Plus, it's named after a good
song. Good song? Good map? WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!</p>
<p>
<em>Ice est Miroir-esque</em>: Some cool peeps be like, &#8220;Dude, this is
cool.&#8221; Then I be like, &#8220;A&#8217;ight, man. You cool.&#8221; And guess what? They
are. MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE LIKING THIS MAP</p>
<p>
<em>Jaws Theme</em>: My first big accomplishment; a break-through, if you
will. This one will always hold I place in my heart. It truly is
something I&#8217;m still proud of today. As nostalgic and generic as it may
seem now, I love it to death.</p>
<p>
<em>Rather the Bomb</em>: Making a worthy puzzle has been something I&#8217;ve
always struggled with, until I was able to make this. Clever? Maybe.
Fascist? Quite possibly. GLAYSHUR? lol!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
<em>Spirits in the Greenest of Skies</em>: As superfluous as fifty
percent of the objects in this map are, I can&#8217;t help but love the way
it moves. Having to traverse all the way around the map is something
I&#8217;ve always been fond of. </p>
<p>
<em>Venue (Mrs. Luci)</em>: This is some of the best object placement
I&#8217;ve ever done. It all clicks together so well, especially the
beginning. I adore it, and so does Tannar. If Tannar adores it, and you
don&#8217;t, you lose at life.</p>
<p>
And now, angry ticks spire out of my nipples.</p>
<p>
MUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUU<br />
HHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOO<br />

Original Monday Night NUMA Map madness. See ""In The Interest Of
Subtlety"".<br>
<br>
The Dangermouse: I made The Dangermouse with my cousin, Flynn. I
consider this to be the peak of my creative output in N, and him to be
the coolest cousin on the face of the planet.<br>
<br>
Snoefall Ravien: I don't think people really got this one. Everyone
seemed to think it was an exceptionally good ""noob map"" or something,
but it wasn't that at all. Anyway, as the description suggests, the
people waiting for you upon completion of the map are from Finland,
meaning that they are, in fact (the) FINNISH. I was going to leave out
the exit terminal, which may have made the whole thing a little
clearer, but that would have just been stupid.<br>
<br>
Stardancer (Fantasy_Check): This may not be such a special map for me,
had it not come out of the mountain of crap that was my Vehemence haul.
nevermore is sexy to mention that this map is characteristic of the
Futurist style, which I take very much as a compliment.<br>
<br>
Pyromania: A Flame inside his Heart: Another map sprungeth from the
experiental ordeal that was Vehemence, which I feel deserves a mention
here. I'd also like to say how I made N levels every waking hour for
four days to get this, and I am not kidding. I did not leave my house
for four days for a fucking 2D platformer. Do not underestimate the
power of Kablizzy, my friends.<br>
<br>
02-3: ""Sexosaur"": A nice aesthetic theme at work here, I think. You may
be surprised to find out that I made the mini-map inside the box first,
and then built the outside area based on that. Working title of
""Window"", which ended up stuck on this
map(<a class=""moz-txt-link-freetext"" href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/54378"">http://numa.notdot.net/map/54378</a>), funnily enough. Heh.&nbsp; <br>
I'd like to mention that although this level says 02-3, it was never
actually placed in an episode. I assigned episodic placements to a
small series of maps which I felt couldn't be released as standalone
creations, but wouldn't work in any real episodic layout.<br>
<br>
Pipes 'n Pipes: I included this simply because Alex made a better map
at exactly the same time, which I'd like to talk about. At first I
resented the way his got liek, over 9,000 more votes than mine, but
I've come to appreciate the beauty and character his Onwards Valiant
Whilst Preydator Reverses - Snap! holds over my Pipes 'n Pipes. I think
his work deserves the recognition. It's so beautiful. *lick* (*Link: <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/72457"">http://numa.notdot.net/map/72457</a>)

do. One of my favourite frames can be found here: <a

<br>
Welcome again to the new season of <i>Nterviewed</i>, as always, I am
The Blizz, <i>Tanner</i> is still on hiatus. This week, I have a man
whom I consider to be a true asset to the community, and a damn fine
mapper, at that. Who is this man, you ask? Why, it's <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Barabajagal""><i>Barabajagal</i></a>.
I sat down with <i>Baraba</i> this week, and as it turns out, he lived
up to all of my expectations.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Welcome to <i>Nterviewed</i>, <i>Baraba</i>. How are you
this evening?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Most excellent.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Good to hear. First and foremost, I've noticed that we
haven't seen as much of you over the past few weeks and months. Not to
pry, but is there anything exciting in the wide world of <i>Baraba</i>
that our readers should know about?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Well, there are two factors really. Firstly, I don't have as
many ideas as I used to, and secondly, I've taken a more serious
interest in music. And that takes up a lot of my time.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Ooh, music, you say? Are you working on anything specific?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Right now I'm learning the guitar (like every other
teenager), playing mostly blues and rock and a little jazz.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Sounds exquisite. Insofar as your presence amongst the
community, You seem to be one of the most level-headed and rational
members that has graced the forums and NUMA, but you stay rather
well-hidden, compared to some of the other big names. By all logic, you
should be more well-known than you are. In fact, some have called you
the community's ""Best-Kept Secret."" Why do you think this is?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> It's a funny thing actually. I'm a very reserved person, and
for many people this really doesn't affect online sociability. For some
reason I just seem to gravitate to wall-flower status. In all
situations.
<br>
<br>
<b>Blizz</b> Well, in either case, you've got a fan in me. There's
something that's been on my mind literally since you joined the
community - Where did you come up with your username? Does it have any
special significance? On that same topic, how'd your nickname of
""Mandrew"" manifest?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Heh, well ""Barabajagal"" is, as some may already know, the
name of a Donavan song. The reason I chose the name is because as a
child I would often listen to my dad's vinyl. I used to love the song.
A few years later I was mature enough to figure out that the song
wasn't about some magic angel, but rather drugs and sex. Anyway, It's
become a sort of symbol in my life for me. And Mandrew... I dunno where
that came from honestly.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Heh. Fair enough. You are heralded by many (Myself included)
as one of the greatest mappers in the community. What inspires you to
map as you do?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Along with music, art has always appealed to me, I think
that sort of carries over into my mapping. I try to pay special
attention to simplicity and cleanness. When I think of a map idea, it
usually comes to me as a series of shapes, like a bunch of triangles or
something like that. Then I just sort of play around and change things
till I like it... Probably more than you cared to know.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Hahahah, not at all. That's what this is all about. On the
topic of mapmaking, are there any tips or advice you could give you the
new members of the community just starting to map?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Yes! Definitely. My number one tip for new mappers is to
look at the levels of the main game (00-99) and to figure out why
they're so fun, then develop your own style retaining that playability.
That's what I did anyway.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> The Metanet levels are definitely a good starting point,
that's how I got my start, as well. A short while ago, you posted what
you called your ""half-assed or just bad maps."" Playing through these,
though, they seem to be absolutely amazing. In fact, some of your most
memorable maps, for me, have appeared in your so-called ""Trash"" packs.
What, if anything, do you attribute this to?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> When I posted those I wasn't entirely sure what people would
make of them. I think of them now as 'sketches'. Short and unpolished I
suppose would be a good description.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> And speaking of packs, your <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=16858"">Bonus</a>
pack is, as many people know, my favourite levelpack to date. How long
did it take you to complete, and are there any sequels in your future?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> I did it over the course of maybe three months, but unevely.
Sometimes I'd make five maps in a day, other times I'd go a week or two
with nothing. As for sequels, I would say my answer is a definite
""maybe.""
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Excellent. I, for one, am looking forward to more from you.
For the longest time, I thought that you were either British or
Australian. It wasn't until maybe half a year ago that I figured out
that you were indeed American. It seems like a rather wide-spread
opinion of you, so why do you think people assume something like that?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> I'm not really sure. I can tell you though that I've been to
both the UK and Australia on vacation and I greatly enjoyed both, maybe
something rubbed off on me.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Perhaps so. A short while back, you participated in <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=12519"">Vehemence</a>
with me. Any chance you'd be up to helping me run a second version,
sometime this summer?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> You're going to do it again? I'd love to go for another
round, hopefully I can clear some time for that.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> I've been pondering it for a while, for those who wanted to
participate in the first, and weren't able to. I'll be looking forward
to that, for sure. Early on in your stay here at Metanet, you posted a
topic about the N puns, and how you were growing tired of them. With
that in mind, how does it feel to be featured in something called ""<i>Nterviewed</i>?""
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Oh, that. Y'know, for all their corniness, N puns really
begin to grow on you.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> You seem to be incredibly well-read for your age, and it
seems as though you are able to excel well in many things you do. Do
you plan on going on to any higher education, and if so, any ideas as
to what you would major in?
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Thanks for the compliment, although I'm not sure how
accurate that statement is in reality. School itself has never appealed
to me, but I think that should I chose to pursue anything like that, I
think that I would get involved with writing. I do love to read.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> As a bit of a humorous aside, how does it feel having been
born after the original <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100758/"">Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles movie</a> was made?
<br>
<b>KA note</b> Which was a fucking awesome film ...<br>
<b>Baraba</b> Clearly, I'm a member of a lost generation.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Hahah. I suppose you could say that. And finally, I've
provided this space for anything you might like to say to all of our
readers.
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Oh, well okay. Contrary to my previous statement, I advise
all of you to stay in school. And don't do drugs if you have an
addictive personality.
<b><br>
<br>
Blizz</b> Excellent, sir. Thank you kindly for your time, it's been a
pleasure.
<b><br>
Baraba</b> Thank you too, it made me feel significant."

<br />
<em>Last Hope: </em>This is actually one of the first maps I finished.
Not the very first, but it was in the first batch. Even today, I like
the look of it. My earliest maps were pretty disgustingly ugly, as
you'd expect from a new mapmaker (especially so early in Numa), but
this one really looks good.<br />
<br />
<em>Don't Blink: </em>""It went like this: The buildings tumbled in on
themselves. Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble and
pulled out their hair. The skyline was beautiful on fire; All twisted
metal stretching upwards, everything washed in a thin orange haze. I
said, 'Kiss me, you're beautiful. These are truly the last days.' You
grabbed my hand and we fell into it. Like a daydream or a fever.""<br />
<br />
<em>Interpretation: </em>I'm proud of the rocket interaction in this
level. I think this is one of my best levels because of that. Any time
you see a rocket turret in a new map of mine, I'm really just trying to
emulate this map.<br />
<br />
<em>Inticed:</em> One of my highest-rated maps since the early days. I
was Top Rated for a long time when the rating system was introduced,
and then I slowly fell to the likes of formica, tktktk, nevermore, and
eventually Clovic. This map held the number 1 spot for the longest
since those days.<br />
<br />
<em>Intact:</em> This is one of my favorite tilesets. Detailed and
stylish. It's like those good tilesets that everyone but me does while
I continue to do blocky shapes.<br />
<br />
<em>LV 00-0: blob seeds: </em>The LV Chronicles started a trend of
episodes and episodic maps in the N community. After this, everyone was
doing episodes and trying to figure out how to make a map ""episodic.""
No one has the answer yet, sadly. The closest you can get is ""Just copy
the LV Chronicles.""<br />
<br />
<em>LV 02-3: ebol-aid:</em> One of my favorite teleporter maps, which I
am at least partially responsible for. This is also one of the popular
favorites from the LV Chronicles pack, along with LV 02-4: in soviet
russia, baby eats you! This is another tileset that I like a lot.<br />
<br />
<em>Circumference: </em>Vent map! Vent maps are made on Ventrilo, the
voice chat program. Vent maps started as a creation of the usual Vent
crew: KinGAleX, krusch, Kablizzy, blue_tetris and me, along with guests
like Clovic, maximo, LouDog and spect. The idea is that everyone gives
vague instructions about what to add to a level, everyone follows the
instructions, and a pack of different maps comes out of it. It's fun,
and it's interesting.<br />
<br />
<em>Coffee: </em>The most bizarre of all the bizarre Vent map games. If
I remember it all, we had blue_tetris reading us a Wikipedia article.
At the same time, he had a song playing in the background. We had to
recognize what article he was reading, what song was playing, and find
what thing linked those two together. <em>After</em> we
found what we thought the link was, we had to make an N map based on
the theme before the song ended. (That gave us maybe two minutes, up to
four if we found the link quickly.) The link for this one ended up
being breakfast drinks.<br />
<br />
<em>Artificial Intelligence: </em>My claim to fame. This is the map that
made ""littleviking001"" a household word around these parts. It's got a
nice amount of challenges, without being too empty or too packed. It's
divided into sections without having sharp transitions. I like the
colors. Good minefield, good eccentricity, nice big shapes. Big shapes
are important. You can quote me on that.<br />

G'd evening, <em>Nterviewed</em> fans. This week, I have the pleasure
and the honour of bringing you a man whom I call kindred. Not in the
real sense, but in the sense that he identifies as readily with rabbits
as I do. Please welcome my fellow bunny-man, the Icy Bunny Mage himself
- <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Leo"">Blizzard</a>! Sit down,
relax, and enjoy the battle of the Blizzes.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Salutations, Blizzard. How are you doing this fine
evening?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> I'm doin' well, you?<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> I'm fantastic, thanks. Now, first things first. You've
been around the forums a whole lot longer than people give you credit
for. Everyone in the community seems to know you, but you seem to stay
so well outside of the spotlight. What's your secret?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> It most likely stems from my activity in certain parts of
the community. Most people know me because I visit the IRC daily,
although me posting on the forums is rare. I've been here for over a
year, and just recently reached 100 posts, which is what people usually
look at when determining ""activity"".<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Yeah, well, IRC brings us together, that's for sure.
You've made a rather large impact upon the community, despite only
having that hundred-and-change number of posts on the forums, and only
a handful of maps on NUMA. What initially drew you further in to the
community, and what keeps you around, where others have gone on to
other things?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> I'm definetly the kind of person who likes hanging out
with friends, be it online or in real life. The internet is home to a
huge variety of people, and the community here at Metanet are exactly
the kind of people that it's fun to hang out with. Being able to talk
about pretty much anything without having to hear ""lol"" half the time
is a side benefit, aswell. Besides, this community is initially what
got me into using good grammar in the first place, so I feel like I owe
something back.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> I agree wholeheartedly. I attribute a lot of the
community being well-behaved for guys like you. So, on another tangent,
Rabbit-to-Rabbit, How'd the whole bunny thing get started for you?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> It all started a couple years ago. I had always liked
animals, but I was never that much into rabbits. I noticed a rabbit in
the pet store window as I walked by, and he kinda seemed to ""call out""
to me. I decided to get him as a pet, and we had a swell time. On the
interesting side, we seemed to be able to comprehend what the other was
tryin' to say. I'd get deeper into it, but it's a rather long story.
Although he ain't around anymore, since then i've been very much so
into rabbits.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> That's awesome. I'm sure our readers would love to
hear the story, if you have the time.
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Sure. Our ability to communicate on a near-human-to-human
level gave us the opportunity to have more of a friend-friend
relationship then a person-pet relationship. He would hang out in my
room, and often sleep in my bed on the pillow next to mine. Although
i'm not much for movies nowadays, whenever I watched one, he would
usually sit and watch them with me. I remember this well, 'cuz he'd
always hop over to me from the other side of the couch to steal popcorn
from me. Unfortunatly, one day, he just kinda dissapeared. We have no
idea where he went. I just woke up one morning, and he was gone. I
still miss him even today...<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Aw, man. I'm sorry to hear that. That's an endearing
story, though. To switch gears a bit, tell me - What's the attraction
of Maple Story? I've never understood it, and I figured there would be
no better person to clear this up than you, considering that you seem
to be quite active in the game.
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Well, there's many differences between the different
languages. I play on the Japanese servers, as they are known for their
kind community. I have a good amount of friends on there, and i've
learned a bit of japanese to get along with the other players. I
suppose what keeps me going is knowing there's always a goal right
around the corner if I work at it. The game gets more fun the deeper
you play into it, which is the main part of why I enjoy playing it.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Interesting. You began a <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=13479"">webcomic</a>,
quite a while ago, and the response seemed quite fantastic. Are there
any plans to continue or revive your comic for us?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> I'm afraid not. I was experimenting with an idea that a
comic could be made with each comic simply stemming from the last one,
but I quickly realized that not having a set-in storyline from the
beginning really harmed the path that it was going on. I do have ideas
for another webcomic, but it wouldn't be N based, and it would be
drawn. The story behind it is still in the making, although I do have a
bit of it ready.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Well, I, for one, would love to see that. You and I
used to work at <a href=""http://www.softnyx-canada.net"">Gunbound
Classic</a> together. How are things going there since I last visited?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Schoolwork has been taking up a lot of my time recently,
and i've had to take somewhat of a break from GBC. I left only about a
week after you, so there's not much that I know that you don't. I'll be
going back there to be active in June or so, so i'll be able to update
you then.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Excellent. As an aside, something I've always wondered
- Your alternate nickname ""Burizado,"" is this a reference to Diablo II,
and the Unique Item, 'Buriza-Do Kyanon?'
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Nope. ""Burizado"" is the japanese pronunciation of
""Blizzard"". I used this nickname for only about a month, because at the
time I was bored of my current alternate name, and I couldn't think of
any other. I don't use ""Burizado"" nowadays.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Ahhhh, I see. As the winner of the first InsomNicon,
and the runner-up to InsomNicon II, are you planning on participating
in InsomNicon III to reclaim your title?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Yep. Insomnicon has always been a fun competition, and I
enjoy participating in it very much. I see that nowadays, the
competition is much more fierce, but i'm confident that I'll do well.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Excellent, I hope you do well next time around. So, I
hear you're an artist, but I've only seen a small bit of your work.
Mind telling our readers a bit more about your sketches, and a bit more
about what you do?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Sure. I draw art in my spare time, usually just for fun.
The majority of my art are anthropomorphic characters. Recently, it's
been chibi art, due to the fact that i'm not quite skilled yet with
drawing proper bodies, but i'm learning quickly. Once i'm as skilled as
I need to be, I'm planning on possibly drawing a webcomic. I have a
real life friend who is a brilliant artist for her age, so she's always
there to teach me what I don't know. If I ever do get started on that
webcomic, i'll be sure to let ya'll know.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Exquisite. I'm sure everyone will be looking forward
to that. The community's most recent gaming vice, Quadradius, has been
taking things by proverbial storm. Will you be participating in the
upcoming tournament?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> No. I've seen Quadradius, and I know most of the
community likes it quite a bit, but the game just isn't quite my cup of
tea. I prefer old-fashtioned strategy games, like chess.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Fair enough. Have you heard of <a
 href=""http://wolfire.com/lugaru.html"">Lugaru</a>? It seems like
something you'd be intrigued by.
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> I noticed a member post about it in the ""Other Games""
section, but no, i've never played it, nor do I plan to. Maybe in the
future, but as of now, no.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Ah, it's pretty fun, you should check it out. On the
topic of mapping, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Leo"">your maps</a>
are really exquisite, but you don't make them often. Why haven't you
made more maps than you have?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> I actually have made a few more maps. I haven't had
access to my NUMA account recently, due to an account error, so I
haven't really been able to release them. Besides, I often need
inspiration to make a good map, which I haven't had much of recently.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Most folk have either released their own map-pack, or
participated in a group effort to release one. Considering that you
don't have access to NUMA, do you have any plans for putting one out
sometime in the future?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> I once had an idea for a mappack, but it didn't turn out
as well as I had expected. I don't think i'm quite cut out to make
mappacks, so no, I don't plan to.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> And finally, I've got a hankering for some Burger
King. Howabout you?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> Not particularly. They've got some darn good Icee's,
though.<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Hahahah, so they do. Thanks so much for your time,
Bunny-man, it's been a pleasure. Anything you'd like to say to our
readers before we depart?
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> ...People are reading this?<br />
<br />
<b>Kablizzy:</b> Hahahahah. Very good, sir. Thanks again!
<b><br />
Blizzard:</b> No prob'. Thanks for interviewin' me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Get your rocket-pants strapped on tight, kids, because next week, we
have ourselves a Legend on our hands. Who, you ask? Why, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you. But rest assured that your face will be stuck in
the upright position.

<h1>Artist
Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>Seems
y'all get a double dose of <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy"">The Big K</a> this week.</p>
<br />
<p><strong><a
 href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/498348"">Ye Mippij!</a></strong></p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that most of these appear in the Legacy
and Expanse packs - I consider my work with the Legacy Team my best.
But what <em>should</em> come as a surprise is... well, I'll
just let you find out yourselves. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Eclectic</em>: I really consider Expanse to be the high point of my
mapping, not just for the Legacy Team, but altogether. There's really
so much more flavor to my Expanse maps than there is to any other
project I've done. And I hope to continue that trend with Zenith. With
Eclectic, this theme shines brightly through. Strangely enough, this
map didn't start off a thing like it ended up - Most of the time, when
I map, I simply jot down designs and ideas that come to me throughout
the day. And oftentimes the limitations of NED force me to be
innovative, and this is the product. When I look for maps to go into
the Legacy packs, this is primarily what I am looking for - Something
innovative, quirky, and fun. And this did all three, so when we were
organizing maps for Expanse to drop, LV picked this one to be our
opener - Something memorable to open the pack is vital.</p>
<p><em>Arrant</em>: Arrant began as a very simple, very plain level. And I'm
not really sure how it ended up in this phase. Early on during my
Expanse mapping, I just sat down one night, and this was the result. I
was pleasantly surprised and amazed that something of this caliber
could actually come out of me like this. But as I toyed around with the
tiles, all of the objects seemed to materialize out of nowhere. But as
far as action maps go, while I love the work that today's authors do,
they lack a certain unique air to their maps - And that's something
that I think Arrant worked into beautifully.</p>
<p><em>T-Minus Zero</em>: Now, don't get me wrong. T-Minus Zero is really
not that great of a map. It's not that innovative, the difficulty
spikes in places where it shouldn't, it has horrendous placement and
aesthetic issues... But it's fun. In a very LittleViking-esque style.
This map was made on December 31st, 2006, the night before Expanse
launched. It took me about fifteen minutes. I'd always had the idea to
make something in a similar vein to MTI, and LittleViking approached
me, saying that we lacked a 59-4 for the pack. Hurriedly, and with an
unbelievable amount of inspiration, I put TMZ together. The naming came
shortly thereafter, when we needed a name that could be easily
Acronymed into something memorable. But after all that was said and
done, we realized that TMZ was really a fun, amazing level. And,
shortly thereafter, I realized that the map was exactly the type of map
that I wanted in the pack. </p>
<p><em>Simplistic</em>: Another of my favourites would be Simplistic. This
is my map that made it into n v1.4, and will be a part of the game
pretty much forever. But the beauty of it, to me, is in the fact that I
created it. I don't usually make great maps, most of my maps, I
consider to be ""Metanet Filler"" maps - I make maps that you would see
in the main game, but aren't all that memorable. But something like
this, for me, is a rarity. It has that quirkiness and that unique flair
to it, and that, to me, is what makes a map great.</p>
<p><em>Kablizzy's Cavern Number Three</em>: I don't think many people
realize how big this map was in its day. With all of the newfangled
DDAs that are around today, people tend to forget how much impact a
simple launchpad DDA was, way back when. But this, in my eyes, was
something that I embarked upon when I was no good at anything else. My
action and puzzle maps were horridly sub-par, and this was the first of
my maps to take me to the top spot on NUMA. But, more surprisingly, the
map stayed there. It stayed there for such a long damn time. And to top
it all off, Kablizzy's Cavern Number Three! was one of the very first
maps to ever hit the 50-vote mark on NUMA. Before this, 50 votes was
absolutely unheard of. And while the DDA isn't all that spectacular in
its own right, I'm glad to know that I was a pioneer in at least some
respects.</p>
<p><em>Amun's Revenge</em>: If there is a map that is more in the style of
Metanet, I have yet to see it. This was made specifically for NedCon 6,
and I pride myself on making Metanet-style maps better than almost
anyone around. This here is the pinnacle of that style, and I
absolutely love it. And plus, this thing almost won me NedCon 6, so
it's definitely critically-acclaimed. But the coolest thing about this
map is that it brings back such good memories for me of the early days
of Metanet, back when no one knew about things like Map Theory and back
before there were no Map Manifestos. And those days were pretty sweet.</p>
<p><em>48-3:
You're Not Here</em>: Originally
named 'Desolation,' this map was based upon a theme of loneliness. The
idea that I was trying to encapsulate was the feeling of nothing, yet
of some impending doom, at the same time. When LV named a map of his
""Desolation,"" I decided to rename mine to a song that I was listening
to at the time, called ""You're Not Here,"" from the Silent Hill 3
Soundtrack. This was initially meant to be a series of maps, but the
others were of a lower quality, and scrapped early on.</p>
<p><em>49-3:
Downward Spiral Staircase</em>: There
aren't many maps of mine that I consider ""innovative."" But the work
that I've done with the Legacy Team has been an experience for me in
what can and can't be done in a map. And this one, even though it began
as just a tileset, quickly turned into something much more. Not only
does it test the player's skills, it also tests them as mapmakers,
opening their mind to more non-linear possibilities. And that's the
biggest thing that I like about this - It makes people look at it, and
say, ""Whoa, what an ugly, but fantastic map!""</p>
<p>
<em>59-1:
Zag</em>: If
Innovation had a name for me, it would be Zag. I'm still blown away by
the awkward simplicity and the strangling difficulty of this thing.
Like most of my maps, it began with the tileset, which was quite a bit
wider at first. But as I began toying with enemy placement, it evolved
into the narrower-passage form that it is now. And, playing through it
the first 50 times or so, I began to figure out the rhythm of the map,
and when I was able to determine how the map flowed, I decided that
this would be my first contribution to Legacy. This was the very first
map of mine that got everyone's consensus to be in the Origins pack,
and it holds a special place for me in kind.</p>
<p><em>Sunset
Sylva (The Sun at my Back)</em>: I
ADORE this map. This is the result of a Zenith collaboration between
myself, LittleViking, and krusch. I garnered the name very early on in
Development, and I had the idea in mind for a map called ""The Sun at my
Back."" When I couldn't execute this well, I asked LV and krusch to help
me out with the map. I explained to them the map's theme, and the
naming, and each one brought their own twist to it. But the coolest
thing about it is the theme. I love maps that are tied together with a
theme, and this one could not get move flavourful than it is now.</p>
<h1>Last Week's Maps</h1>
<p>This week I decided I'd test something out. I've always wondered if
this publication really adds anything to the NUMA community, so I took
down the stats of the maps from last week, to compare with the stats at
the end of the week.</p>
<p><em>Directly Before TSN Publication Last Week</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/88292"">AMLT's Map</a>: 4.5 from 10

<p><em>Directly Before TSN Publication This Week</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/88292"">AMLT's Map</a>: 4 from 13
ratings, 18 comments, 4 demos.<br />
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/88184"">seven_two's Map</a>: 4.5

<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/88210"">skyline356's Map</a>: 4 from
27 ratings, 24 comments, 9 demos.</p>
<br />
<p>Maybe it was a slow week, but it seems that all I really do is hand out
an extra 4.5 ratings per map, for an average decrease in rating of 0.5.</p>
<p>I'm going to do this again this week, since there'll be more maps to
get a real feel from.</p>
<p>However, don't let this segment affect your actions with the maps. I'd
rather gather data about what you normally do, not what you do once I
tell you what I'm up to.</p>
<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy"">Matt Blaylock</a></p>
<p>
I'd like to welcome everyone back for another week of <em>Nterviewed</em>,
but more importantly, I would like for everyone to welcome a man whom I
have known for nearly three years now. While that isn't a long time by
any measure, I have come to call this man a friend, a confidant, and a
brother. Not many people these days know who <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/maximo"">maximo</a></em> is, but if
you want to know about one of the most influential men this community
has seen, then read on.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Welcome, maximo! How are you this evening?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Very very swell, and yourself?</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> I'm excellent, thanks. Let's get started. Before <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/5080"">Mother Thumping Impossible</a>
was even a passing thought in blue_tetris' mind, and long before <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/4959"">Plue</a> ever graced the pages
of NUMA, there was a little map named <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/660"">Mount Doom</a>. Tell us how it
feels to have Mount Doom as a level in the game, but also as level 89-4?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Well, when the news hit that Mare and Raigan were doing
a column of userlevels in the game, there was an instant surge of
comments about what map should be last. I was really excited a lot of
the players wanted Mount Doom at the final slot. Before 1.4 came out
the duo emailed me (well, Mare emailed me) to ask what I thought about
them editing the map a little since one of the locked doors was
unnecessary. I was nosy and asked where in the column it was going to
be and they said 89-4. It was about that time I got up and danced. It
felt good being recognized by the makers of the game I've dumped more
time into than most WoW players dump into getting to level 70.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> I'd imagine so. And speaking of which, you have spent
more time at Metanet than almost anyone I know. You were around before
the implementation of DDA maps, before race maps, before NedCon, and
even before the NUMA login system. Having seen the Metanet community
through its infancy and adolescence, how does it feel to be such an
influential force to so many aspects of Metanet?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Well, it's really interesting now since I'm such a moot
force, but looking back and thinking about all the things I've done
it's certainly mind boggling. The thing I did better than anyone during
the first year I was around is just map a bloody ton. I think up until
a year ago, I was mapping at least twice a day, if even for a minute or
two. It was honestly a bit obsessive but I loved it. I've seen just
about every innovation to come out of the community, map-making wise. I
was never really an innovator myself, I just made simple maps (see:
symmetrical, with turrets of some sort) and people loved them. You were
really the reason I did so much on the forums with tournaments and all
so that's not really the part of my legacy I'm proud of, I'm more proud
of my maps.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> And speaking of which, you've made so many great maps
over the years, but you must have a favourite. Which map of yours would
you call your favourite, and why?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> I go back and forth, really. First, let me say I don't
like Mount Doom as much as everyone else does so it's not that. Plue
comes to mind since the reaction on numa was so positive. I love
watching people play my maps and seeing what runs and routes they come
up with. It's really rewarding to see what works in maps you didn't see
when you were play testing, so all the replays on plue were just great.
I love breaking my ""style,"" I guess, and doing something I don't
usually do though, I just don't have a lot of maps that emphasize this.
I loved a lot of the work I did for Legacy, but nothing stands out to
me. I did love Angular for the original NedCon, but no one remembers it
because flipside won even though it wasn't as good, just prettier. I
guess Plue is my answer, in so many words.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> So many words indeed. You were the first moderator on
the forums, alongside myself and <em>Tsukatu</em>. How did it feel then
to be the community's first moderator?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Well, I was very excited to be recognized again as a
factor in the community. A little pat on the back always feels good,
especially by a group of people I loved to talk with. I never did a
whole lot in terms of mod work, but I loved being able to guide the
community and set the tone for conversation there.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> And how has that view changed over the years?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> No one knows me now, it has lost a lot of its meaning to
me personally. They only things I do now are poke around serious
discussion from time to time and make sure stuff there isn't out of
order and what-not. Since the first time I left the community 2 summers
ago I've been hardly active for more than month spurts at a time, the
title doesn't really mean a lot since I don't know the people as well
as I would like to, It's just hard to invest as much time as I did into
the forums, thank my fianc&eacute; for that one.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Yeah, I hear you're getting married in the
not-too-distant future. Will that mark the end of maximo's presence at
Metanet?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> I hope not. I love Mare and Raigan and their work. I
love N, and I'm confident that I'll love Robotology. In fact, I hope
that Robotology will be good for us all since we'll all start off at
zero and I'll get to be part of a growing innovating community again
from the start. So, to answer your question, only time will tell,
really (and, to a point, my wife-to-be; she's good looking and I listen
to her).</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Heheh, indeed. So, considering how long you've been
staff, and how long you've been a part of the community, how has the
community evolved since you joined?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Other than growing from a small group of people who had
no life to a massive n00b eating community monster not much. It's been
crazy to see people come and go and come back and go again and come
back (Beyond myself). I've been excited about all the growth for Mare
and Raigan, their game deserves the recognition it's gotten thus far
and I only hope Metanet takes off and becomes self sufficient for them
both in the future, they've put in the hours, that's for sure. But by
the same token I do miss the days of 100 members and when any map came
out it was a big deal. The first maps before NUMA where only one map
would come out a week was just great, it's a whole 'nother galaxy now.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Definitely. Ah, I miss those days. So, through all of
this, how has being a mod and being an influential member of Metanet
changed you, as a person?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> A lot actually. By communication skills two years ago
pale to what they are now. I've learned a lot about people, a lot of
things you don't expect out of a videogame community. It's been just a
great time and I've made a couple friendships I know will last long
past this game or the next.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Absolutely. It's amazing how much Metanet has given to
us. How do you deal with being a role model for the impressionable
young minds here in the community, before and now?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> I guess my mantra has always been to stick to what I
know and do that well. I can't be a role model for everyone, I don't
think everyone should be like me. I just try to be open and honest and
the response you get from people is always genuine.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Always a good policy. You and <em>LittleViking</em> and
I came up with the idea, a few years ago, of a Metanet Convention, and
we've wanted to do something like that for some time now. Trogdor
recently attempted to put one together, and I would like for us to get
an official one endorsed by Mare and Raigan. Would you still be up for
organizing something like that, perhaps in Toronto?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Regrettably, my funds for the next ever are tied up in
starting a family. I do get to go to California next year and hopefully
meet up with LV, and as soon as you get a life and move to the Midwest
to be with me we can start talking. Honestly though meeting Mare an
Raigan would be awkward, how do you talk to the two people who have
wasted more of your life than anyone else. ""So um, you guys make a
great game, thanks.""</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Hahah. I'd imagine there would be much groveling
involved. So, yourself, <em>LittleViking</em>, <em>blue_tetris</em> and I
have been working on some side-projects, a few of which we've codenamed
""TLO,"" ""Daedalus,"" and ""Arley Portuna."" Most importantly, since you and
I are heading up the TLO project, why don't you let our readers in on
our plans for that, and explain a bit about it?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Tactics Lord Online is my little turn based strategy
game roughly in line with Tactics Arena Online (The names aren't the
same, and no I didn't steal it, shut up). It's been a lot of fun to
design and play, and I even made a paper version so I can play now
since I can't code it worth a crap and play online. The game has two
teams with different units on each side of a hexagonal map, the
objective is to move your pieces and capture keeps and castles to win.
It's just a blast to play and really makes you think. So now we just
need CODERS who want to donate the next month or so of their life to
the game and it's a go. We really want to make the game and set up
servers for players, it's just too good of a game to not make.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Indeed. I've since forgotten, but a while back, you
suggested a name for our software company that I absolutely loved. What
was it again?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Interactive obsession. I liked it more before I found
out the logo I had designed for it has been used about umpteen times by
other companies.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Yes! That's the one! I still love that name. Off on
another tangent, what do you see in store for Metanet this year?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Hopefully N+ on xbox gets them some great rep amongst
gamers out there and I can't wait to see what happens with robotology
and 1.5. They are a great team and great people, I don't see how great
things aren't in store.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Aye, I know we're all pulling for them. As head of the
Legacy Team, how would you say Legacy has impacted the community?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Our biggest innovation has by far been the level pack,
before Legacy there wasn't anything like multi-user level packs (at
least not of the magnitude of what we did) and after Legacy just look
at the number of level packs out there. Other than that we just pissed
a lot of people off I think, but it was all worth it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Agreed. It's been a fantastic experience, for sure.
Now, you began a short story a while ago, entitled ""Way."" Are there any
future episodes in the works?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Nope, it sorta died out. It was a blast to write but
community interest wasn't as enthusiastic as I had hoped. If people
want more I would love to write it, it's just a blast to do. I guess
it's in the hands of the readers if they want more or not.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> If you had to pick a favourite sports team, who would
it be, and why?<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> I haven't watched sports in 2 years now (see: school +
girlfriend = !sports) but I guess the St. Louis cardinals just because
there my home team and my favorite sport.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Excellent. And finally, if you'd like to provide some
words of wisdom for all reading this, I've reserved this space for that
very reason. So, with that in mind, take it away.<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> Love people, and you'll find just how worth loving they
can be.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kablizzy:</strong> Thank you kindly, maximo. It was a pleasure.<br />
<strong>maximo:</strong> I agree, thank you much.</p>

<p>Here we
have: <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/rocket_thumped""><em>rocket_thumped</em></a>!</p>
<br />
<p><a
 href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/586885"">Mappiepoos</a></p>
<p>
<em>""Long Distance Call""</em>: This map was equally inspired by one of my
good friends paintings at school and Jiggerjaw. It&amp;#8216;s one of
those one shape jumper puzzle and I think I pulled it off. It has some
pretty easy corner jumps and a few tough angular falls. I still love it
as much as the day I submitted it.<br />
<br />
<em>A Lighter Shade of Pink</em>: I made this map for the map pack
lord_day and I had made. It's a good jumper, but it was a lot more to
me. It opened up map making a lot for me and really changed my approach
to map making. The map was pretty tough, but rather easy to make, I
churned it out pretty quickly. I was always disappointed about how
little attention this map had received.<br />
<br />
<em>Chicago</em>: This map really opened my eyes to what exactly could be
done in a map, which is rather sad since it's my 214th map. Better late
then never eh?&nbsp; It is a bit too hard though. It was one of those maps I
made to pull your hair out, but ended up being so much more. It was
going to be in the Horizon project but was deemed too difficult by
lord_day and Evil_Bob, pusses...<br />
<br />
<em>Cucumber Enigma</em>: I made this map for Nedcon 7 back almost a year
ago. This was back in the days when I was hip, when I could make
anything and it would be received well. The map its self actually
didn't do too well until Base played it. He fell in love with it and
pretty much nagged everyone in to playing it until it eventually gained
the fame and status it has now.<br />
<br />
<em>Dislocated Day</em>: I actually got this idea from a DDA Clifty is
working on. It's the single most painful map I have ever made. Never,
ever, have I put so much effort in to one concept. I had actually made
a completely different attempt that had failed. Unfortunately it was
way too difficult than I was hoping for. I would love to make another
one of these.<br />
<br />
<em>Flower Sex</em>: This map came to me in a dream. The level its self
is just so exciting to me, I mean you have to navigate most of the
level without tiles. You have to figure out which combination of
triggering thwumps and worry about falling without any floor to land
on. I thought it was pretty damn innovative so I was disappointed when
people didn't take it so well. The map made a great difficult level for
the Session 4 pack.<br />
<br />
<em>I'm</em> <em>Afraid of the Clouds Attacking</em>...: Before this map
it was pretty much decided I was going to make races exclusively, but
after seeing the success I decided maybe I should make more actions,
puzzles, whatever. In other words, if it weren't for this map, I would
most likely be like Marija-whats-his-name. That isn't something I would
be happy about.<br />
<br />
<em>In the Morning of the Magicians</em>: This map is like spelunking in
space and the deep sea at the same time. It's so chaotic and surreal to
me. This map is most likely the best representation of my current
style, which unfortunately isn't seen much due to the Horizon project.
Not to mention this song kicks more ass than superman.<br />
<br />
<em>Loco Bilo</em>, <em>Texcoco</em>, <em>and the Robo Named Armadilo</em>:
Sadly this map is probably the most fun you will find in a map that I
have submitted to numa. The map is space age and fast as hell, two
things I absolutely love. LV and I really worked well together on this
map, it almost took longer to think of a name than it did to make the
map its self.<br />
<br />
<em>Painting the Roses Red</em>: This map is perfect in its self. I don't
think we could have done a better job. If only the making of the map
went as smoothly as the map had turned out. krusch had turned out to be
too whimsical for me too handle and we spent nearly half the time
arguing about gauss placement. But, in the long run it ended up helping
me more than anything.<br />
<br />
<em>Scrap Yard of my Soul</em>: Really, before I submitted this map I had
fallen into the shadows in the whole race scene as new names like frogs
and dejablue had appeared and were making rather good races. Then
dejablue came to me wanting to make a race map pack, I said yes. I then
talked to LV, Baraba, Linus, and KA about races. Having heard what they
had to say I created this and four other races that blew me in to race
fame.<br />
<br />
<em>The Tax Man</em>... Naked: I just love the stripped down feel of this
map. I had actually submitted this a few days before the Dronies
deadline, but the map received little attention and only received eight
votes. So, I resubmitted it one day after the Dronies deadline and it
ended up going seventy something votes 5/5. This map pretty much tagged
me as a kra race maker. Which is kind of disappointing, I do make other
kinds of maps.<br />
<br />
<em>White Unicorn</em>: When I was making this map I was aiming for a
fast, flowy and overall lighter version of MTI. I actually made it
something like four in the morning. I was actually quite surprised it
did that well, but I'm not complaining.<br />
<br />
<em>Apocalypse Please</em>: I was trying to think of a good puzzle idea
and my mind came to chain guns. I wanted to make it exciting, and
something that is exciting is being forced to come in to close contact
with chain guns. I just couldn't come up with a good map based on the
concept. So when Loudog asked on the irc for a good Map Mongers theme,
so I brought it up. And it just happened to be enough to force me to
come up with a good map using the concept.<br />
<br />
<em>The Art of Altercation</em>: I love this level, it's so simple yet so
fun to play. And not only did it do well on numa. I pretty much ended
the argument between lord_day and I, are bounce blocks or one-ways
better? Bounce blocks are so much better than one-ways and will be
forever. End of story.
</p>

Peace out homies. See you next week.</p>"

DDA star on the scene, <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Clifty""><em>Kwifteeeeeeeeeee</em></a>!</p>
<p>
<a href=""http://pastebin.ca/raw/595243"">MAP MAP MAP???</a></p>
<br />
<p>
<em>Tailed</em>: I feel this concept had a lot of potential, and then I
just didn&#8217;t use it. I tried making a prisoner DDA more recently, and it
was awful, so I abandoned it. Oh well.</p>
<p>
<em>Doors II</em>: AsTimeFliesBy didn&#8217;t like this map. But krusch did. So
there.</p>
<p>
<em>Debris</em>: I think this was the point where people started to
notice me. Debris was my first multi enemy DDA, and it took forever.
It&#8217;s more simple than some of my more recent DDAs, but I still love it.</p>
<p>
<em>THE NEW PROPULSION!!!</em>: This actually happened because I
accidently NaN&#8217;d a locked door in one of my other maps, and noticed
that it propelled the ninja. I worked out how it&#8217;d happened, and made a
map out of it. It took almost no time at all to make as well, less than
an hour.</p>
<p>
<em>Doors V</em>: Yeah, you knew this was coming. This map had the second
largest amount of time put into it, the most being something I&#8217;m still
working on. I was so happy when I finally got it finished. And I didn&#8217;t
even think it was that great. I mean, it was innovative and all, but
not top rated worthy. Well, it got fifty eight votes in 24 hours. FIFTY
EIGHT. That was nice. It wasn&#8217;t originally going to be a KRADDA, but it
was really boring when I started, so I stuck a rocket in.</p>
<p>
<em>Firecracker</em>: I love this map so much. Best suggestion by George,
EVER.</p>
<p>
<em>The Right Angle</em>: This was inspired by kakutouka by scythe33.
Awesome map. I wish I hadn&#8217;t used all bounceblocks though, I thought
that subtracted from the final result. Still, 39 times through the
walls is pretty damn good I reckon.</p>
<p>
<em>Face Off:</em> Well, Bluenin sent me a PM asking if I wanted to make
a collab DDA. I said yes. If you ask me, making this map was more fun
than when I was making most of my maps, except maybe Firecracker. It
was great fun trying out a collab DDA, and I think it came out great.</p>
<p>
<em>Temperamental</em>: I never understood why no one saw that this was
innovative. &#8216;Twas the first tower loop without any items at all. (Well,
a ninja and an exit.) It took me hours to get the launcher at the start
right. I didn&#8217;t actually have to do the rest of the DDA, I just wanted
to give it a complete feel.</p>
<p>
<em>That Subtle 12% think they can get away with anything</em>: YEAH. AN
ACTION MAP. DIDN&#8217;T SEE THAT ONE COMING DID YOU. Well, Mr_M finally
convinced me to make an action map, and so we collab&#8217;d and this was the
result. I&#8217;ve made a few more action maps recently, but I haven&#8217;t
actually submitted any.</p>
<br />
<p>
Tune in next week for someone! It's becoming harder and harder for me
to find people for this, considering I spend most of my time on the
IRC. If there's anyone reading this who thinks I'd like to give them a
shot, leave me a comment in the comments section.<br />
<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By Tanner Rogalsky</p><br />
<p> <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sendy""
 style=""font-style: italic;"" title=""Sendy"">Sendy</a> is probably my favourite author
on NUMA. She's among the most prolific authors and she makes tilesets
that consistently change my ideas of what is possible with only eight
different tiles. I don't know how she churns them out, but I'm sure
glad she does. Check out <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/54410""
 title=""Abstract thoughts pretending to be biscuits"">Abstract thoughts
pretending to be biscuits</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tanner: </strong>Is there a
single theme or component that you feel unites all your maps?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> Nothing concrete. But I
think that the way that my mind works is evident if you look at a bunch
of my maps. I tend to enjoy creating 'devices' and quirky object
setups, and I tend towards complication. For the first couple of years
my mapping suffered from this but now I feel more able to dilute the
complexity and deviousness and weave it more subtly into the fabric of
the map, allowing a sense of curiosity to arise in the player as
opposed to a sense of frustration and confusion.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Where do you get
inspiration for your tilesets?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> A lot of the time, from
the way the ninja moves. The game is so incredibly sensitive that it's
almost as if you can feel the terrain touching against your fingers in
empathy with the ninja. Again my tilesets tend towards complexity and
I'm very fond of combining contrasts such as straight edges with eroded
sections. A lot of my inspiration comes from doodling, since I like
drawing 2D worlds, and of course listening to music. Also I like to
consider all the landscapes and architecture I've seen recently that
stuck in my head.<br />
<br />
Another factor is that the tileset is highly symbolic of the will of
the author. By defining what's solid and what isn't, where the ninja
can go and what kind of surfaces it will have at it's disposal, there
is an almost sacred power attached to that, and this inspires me to
express myself as fully as I can with tilesets.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What is your favourite
type of map?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> The kind of map that
makes the mechanics of N feel entirely new to me when I play it. One
that makes me look at a certain object in a whole new light. One that
makes me giggle and scream!<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Do your favourite type
of map to play and your favourite type of map to make differ?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> Not especially. I make
maps primarily for myself. I have a soft spot for well thought-out
linear maps on both sides of the equation, but nonlinear maps are often
more tricky to make. Er... Make of that what you will.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> You also make music.
How does that compare to making a map?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> It's all about playing
with expectations and setting up tension and release. Not to mention
form and themes. I find all creative acts similar, it's just the skill
sets are different.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Is The Nth Dimension
going anywhere?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> Yes. I have tons of maps
for it now! Personally I think it's my best work yet - I've managed to
incorporate minimalism into my style without it going awry, which I
feel was important to master for the episodic format. There are a lot
of easier levels in the pack and lots of whimsical playing around with
concepts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Where did the name ""The
Love Sessions"" come from?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> It was made during a
period of time when I stayed with my boyfriend. We have a long distance
relationship, so the time we have together is always special. When I
had nothing to do I would sit down for 30 minutes and force out a map.
They're almost like a diary, taking me back to each day we shared,
though the advantage is nobody else could read it!<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> How do you think being
one of the few well-known women sets you apart on NUMA?<br />
<strong>Sendy:</strong> I'm not really sure. I'm
surprised more girls don't do level designing. I always find it's a
great outlet for my energy. And recently it feels like my creativity
has skyrocketed. Plus I like the attention.</p>"

<a href=""http://pastebin.ca/raw/622940"">The Late Maps</a></p>
<br />
<p>
<em>Wired</em>: I made this map when I was on my glitch spree. I was
trying to really push the limit of what I could do in a level. I went
and submitted it under the retired uncategorived category as well as an
added bonus (thanks to templex). The level in my opinion is more of a
great glitch level and not as amzing gameplay wise.</p><p>
<em>Fracture</em>: This level was my first ever level where I put a
constriction on what the player could do. The level is 1. difficult to
complete and 2. has no exit. Still I think it is quite inovate and
pretty fun.</p><p>
<em>4-1: Challenger Deep</em>: From my attempts at episodes I think that
this is one of my better levels. It was a pretty cool concept that I
was playing around with and the result was pretty fun. Out of all of my
episodic levels I think that this one stands out the most.</p><p>
<em>Chasm</em>: A cool swist on the whole ""long passage run around and
jump over things"" type levels. I love the timeing that worked out and
also the lower tiles that add some sparkle to the level.</p><p>
<em>Chill</em>: Chill is one of my favorite levels. It is fun to play,
short and sweet. I always like the style of the diagonal reflection and
so when it works out so well it makes me very happy ^_^</p><p>
<em>Waii</em>: I love the tiles that I did for this one as well as the
gameplay. It is one of my favorite styles of tiles that I should try
and reproduce more often. Despite it linearity I still think it is one
of my best.</p><p>
<em>Bread Crumb Trail</em>: All you can Eat: This level was completly and
accident. usualy when I make a puzzle map I have a planed ideas and
have a pretty good idea of what I am going to do. When making this I
made the traps and then added the gold to make it so the player could
get through it. At that point it was incredibly easy. I was planning on
just making a path to the exit but when I played the level I realized
that If I made the player go back through the same maze they had just
come from it would create much more a challenge as well as creat
something new and inovative. I was really suprised and quite pleased
with the outcome.</p><p>
<em>Armageddon Poison Gas</em>: I overuse chainguns alot in my older
levels. I have many that are ridiculously hard. But this one is much
easier as well as more predictable and still posing a challenge.</p><p>
<em>Chevuex</em>: I usualy stick to linear, closed levels. These, while
sometimes being quite enjoyable in some cases, can be very boring. Even
currently I strugle with making levels that let the player decide what
to do and not driving a path from them to take that I have planned down
to the last jump. This level I love becuase I can find a new way to
play it every time and in many of my newer levels I strive to create a
similar effect.</p><p>
<em>If You Don't Like Skydiving Settle Down and Build a House</em>: My
most recent map that I am including here. I started by making it a
level that you would be live skydivng (like the falling part at teh
begining). It kinda sucked so I built a house. Out of traps. And it got
pretty big. Then I added alot more gold and mines and practicaly remade
the level.</p>
<p>
I think Sendy's on next week. Maybs.</p>

you know? <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/79359""

</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> How was <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=9751""
 title=""St Atilla's College for Ninja"">St Atilla's College for Ninja</a>conceived? Was it a natural birth?<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>I summoned it fully
formed from the nether planes. 20 Hit Dice of newbies had surrounded
the forum and <a href=""http://www.maestrosync.com/nehs/"" title=""NEHS"">NEHS</a>
was mortally wounded. I figured it was time to intervene before someone
cast Feryn's Flaming Post.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Would you say that
it's reached greatest potential or do you think that there will be more
added to it?<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>I don't think it will
change until v1.5 is released. As is, it covers more or less all the
tricks of the game - the rest is mostly a matter of practice. However,
the next version of N will have alterations to the physics, and some
enemies - in particular, better paths for drones and floorguards. We'll
probably have to add some levels - or at the least change a couple of
descriptions - to deal with the changes.<br />
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Can you be counted
on to put together something similar for Robotology?<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>Regretfully, no. I'm
not sure that I'll purchase Robotology, nor that I will still be an
active member of the community when it is released. For a start, I will
finish my degree later this year - some things will have to change.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> We have <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=11455"">Atilla's Quintilogy of Five</a> and <a href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=12784"">Atillus Secondus</a>. Do you have any desire to
release a third map pack?<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>You want to know?
Elucidation comes first. See?<br />
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Was your user name
in any way influenced by a certain Mongoloid?<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>If you must know, I
was accused of being related to a certain Hun after a string of
particularly sarcastic remarks. I have not always been the paragon of
patience and benevolence I am now. I use the double L instead of a
double T because it's less common and thus more distinctive.<br />
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Do you act mad
because you think you're better than the rest of us?<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>People who think I act
mad haven't got the joke.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Two trains leave a
station at exactly the same time, travelling on parallel tracks.&nbsp;Both
trains are identical but one has a slight eccentricity in it's wheels
that causes it's coefficient of friction to be 0.1 less than that of
the other train. Given a five hour trip, a weight of 100 tons each, an
acceleration of 7.5 mph/s and a maximum speed of 120 mph, how many
minutes will the first train arrive behind the second if both the wheel
and the track are made of hard steel.<br />
<strong>Atilla: </strong>None. According to the
question, the trip time for both trains is five hours.
</p>"
34,"<p>Apologies for the lateness, my fellow wayfarers from the hometown of
Cunt. No Nterviewed this week. Tanner wasn't feeling up to it. Also, I
have been rather busy, so it might not be as perfect a job as you
expect from me. Oh well, what can you do?</p>

<p><em>Jenga</em>: It's pretty, fun, and requires timing. The simplicity of
it appeals to me. Quite at odds with maps like Zwitterion, or Internal
Jocularity. My demo was satisfyingly good fun to make.<br />
<br />
<em>Swift Wings &amp; No Regrets<br />
Unhealed &amp; Alone<br />
High Hopes &amp; Uncertainty</em>: I'll talk about these maps together,
as they're part of a series. Almost every time I begin making a map, I
end up with this sort of layout; extensive, interlocking segments and a
horizontal symmetry. With other maps, I either muddle sections
together, or my interest is taken by a single element which I
experiment with. These three maps represent my best attempts at
capturing the aesthetic ideal I can't help but strive towards with
every blank canvas. I like to think my writing functions in the same
way as this trilogy; thoughtfully constructed, but with little public
appeal, as it is often impenetrable.<br />
<br />
<em>Scarab</em>: My favourite tileset. The spacing of the map makes for
interesting gameplay, though some of my placement looks dubious in
retrospect. One of the few maps where I'm happy with the name, too.<br />
<br />
<em>Lucy's in a Pie with Spices</em>: I like patterns. Often, my
tinkerings with visual appeal don't produce playable, or least,
enjoyable action maps. LiaPwS is the most notable exception; it's
smooth, challenging and KinGAleX liked it. Look for it on an Xbox near
-you-.<br />
<br />
<em>Leave Pass II</em>: It's just -so- hard, but in a cleaner way than my
earlier jagged-tileset maps. I edited more extensively with this map,
and sought help with the flow, which is evident in the friendlier
gameplay. I think of LPII as ""Classic Kashkin.""<br />
<br />
<em>Like Cocaine</em>: With Like Cocaine, I tried to combine two styles
that I had explored previously: that of the open bounce-block vs
rockets maps, and the pointy-structures with mines maps. It worked, so
I'll be forever proud of this map.<br />
<br />
<em>Pyramids</em>: Perhaps this is the most inspired of my ASF maps. I do
love the contrast between the sections. At the time I was listening to
a lot of prog-rock, so I tend to think of this map in that style. From
memory, this was Alex's favourite ASF map of mine, so that probably
strengthened the connection.<br />
<br />
<em>Zeit fur das Herz</em>: Translated as ""Time for the Heart."" Yes, that
is meant to be a heart. Several prototypes were cast aside before I
decided to draw out arterial mine paths. It looks cluttered, but it
turned out as a nice challenge.<br />
<br />
<em>He's not Heavy, He's My Mound of Gold!</em>: Usually I make a map,
realise it's furiously frustrating, and then submit it anyway. Here, I
tried to hone in on the inner orb of vexatiousness that exists within
my imagination. Aside from the squeeze and dual rockets, which are both
explicitly irritating; the entire map is constructed on an awkward
angle. Not to mention the obligatory gold collection. There's a defiant
sort of fun to be had, for the cool-headed.</p>

<p>
A <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/99011"">map</a> of both stylistic

<p>
<em>Senor: </em>This was my second map on Numa, and one of the first
that I made. I still love it to this day. It has a great feel to it,
and is fairly simple. The drones were a last minute idea, if I remember
correctly.</p><p>
<em>Czar: </em>When I felt that the time was right to start my episodes,
I created this map. I love the tunnel apsect of it, and how quick the
map is. It really forces you to think quickly. But then you have the
choice of completing the map without the gold.</p><p>
<em>Shakespear:</em> Most definately one of my most celebrated maps.
krusch helped me turn the basic idea that I had into some fine tuned
aesthetics. I fine tuned some bits and made it my own, I think. I love
the map because you feel the size of the tiles, and you become dwarfed
by them. Once again, it's fairly quick and sweet and interesting.</p><p>
<em>Early 802:</em> Wow. I remember making this map and thinking that I
really had something going. As it turns out, others thought the same. I
love playing this map. It embodies Space Age, one of my styles that I
am known for. I'm partial to making vertical caves with gold at the top
because I love how it slows the map down. That became a goal for me,
due to the fact that I noticed how short my maps were. Z snap gold!</p><p>
<em>Bust A Move:</em> The title is a laugh, first off. I named it so
because of the thumbnail, and because the song is great. This is my
Metanet style, the other style that people know me for. This one is
choc-full of flow and simple aesthetics. Easy to make, quick to play
and quick to finish. The only thing that I didn't like at that time was
the fact that I (and other authors) had a sniper. I guess it didn't
help when I abused him.</p><p>
<em>Four Kicks:</em> Inspired by an 90s TV show, I wanted to go absract
to see how well it would turn out. The mine placement is copied
straight from a krusch map, but the rest is all me. Once again, empty
but fun. It you flick through my maps, you'll see that I stopped this
style after a short period.<br />
Oh, and I made this before Yahoozy coined this style, :P</p><p>
<em>Van Gogh's Starry Night:</em> I have to put in a word for this one.
This map is most likely the one I have spent the most time on, which is
a rarity for me, being the person who can make a decent map in 10
minutes or less.<br />
I tried to make it as close as I could the the Van Gogh it's self. And
I wanted to make it playable to add another likeable element to it. I
made it for krusch and KA.</p><p>
<em>Gengar el Sinister:</em> It's freaking Gengar. How could I not?
Seriously?</p><p>
<em>Soothing ACTION ACTION ACTION!:</em> I used to make maps like this
when I first started. It feels so old to me, and it's one of my
favourite maps that I have made. the whole scheme and length of the map
makes it all the more special. It was dedicated to Dave.</p><p>
<em>Flight Response:</em> I thought that I'd end this with my first map
on NUMA. I love it so much. 8 tiles, gauss and square gold clusters.
Oh, yes.</p>
<br />

another week, adieu. xx</p>"

<p>Greatest
mapmaker (of all time?), <a href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/675721"">thecalcgenius</a>!</p>
<br />
<p>
First of all, congratulations to NUMA on the 100,000 map milestone.<br />
<br />
The Post-Modern Nuzzle: This map was, at first, going to be like
nothing you saw here. My original plan for this map was to have
distinct top and bottom portions, where the bottom portion contained
two gauss turrets and a rocket placed in a flat isosceles triangle and
had gold pieces lined up in a symmetrical Fibonacci sequence about 2-4
x-snaps away from each other. That whole group of enemies/gold was to
be shifted three tiles to the right. On the far right side, there was
to be a hole where the exit switch lay (you could only pass through it
down, and exit the hole through the left), and the exit was to be one
tile length to the left of a statue of Kablizzy and his brand new 3-D
printer (complete with Kapenis replica!)--<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
Anyways, stuff happened, I used my differential equations skills to
calculate the awesomeness of said nuzzle map, rotated random crap by 45
degrees for good measure, and then I submitted it. Unfortunately, I had
forgotten that the only way to become a decent mapmaker was to post
something semi-n00bish first, and then improve on it later on. sadly id
already submitted it and it had been both sized n commented by blizzy
so what could i do? i couldnt delete that map without making fans angry
and sometihng liek that. so i sed hey im gonna be on teh sunday n so i
should just become relly noobish and then i could become better later
and then ppl would liek me and then id be famous and then keron would
bow down to me 4ever. so anyways i taught that was pure genius and then
i said i think im gonna do that. so here goes guys, hope u liek it<br />

<a

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/yahoozy_Guacamole"">Yahoozy</a><br />
<br />
4/5<br />
This
is a fun map. The two similar styles of Infinitum and Yahoozy have made
this an interesting and fun experiance to play. The tileset, although
being ragged and rough (in the way that Yahoozy's maps are), it
provides great flow throught the map. The gold is placed neatly but
doesn't follow a particular pattern which is nice.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br /> Pros:<br />
-Excellent flow<br />
-Nice gold placement<br />
-Fun experience<br />
<br />

<br />
<br /> Cons:<br />
-The rocket can prove to be annoying<br />
-Mines which do not add to gameplay
<br /><br /> <br />
<br />

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/holy_trinity"">holy_trinity</a><br />
<br /> 2/5<br />
At
first glance you can tell this isn't going to be great. The tileset is
ugly and the gold is all over the place. A good idea which is
implemented in this map is that you have to take a tunnel in line with
a rocket. To do this you must first find a trap door but unfortunately
you have to do it for all four sides and the thwumps make this
extremely annoying.
<br />
<br /> Pros:<br />
-Interesting idea (but definately a widely used one)<br />
-Drones add a good challenge
<br />
<br /> Cons:<br />
-Ugly tileset<br />
-Crap gold placement<br />
-Extremely cluttered<br />
-Ugh<br />

<br /><br /> 0.5/5<br />
Oh,
god no. Randomly scattered E tiles and 7 tiles. Random gold. Over 30
drones, many of which do nothing. There are a few locked doors but
what's the point if you get them as soon as you start? Most of the
drones are set to circle around in mid air. This is horrible.
<br />
<br /> Pros:<br />
-rebelzx at least put a ninja in.
<br />
<br /> Cons:<br />
-Horrible tileset<br />
-No doubt this will lag on slower computers<br />
-Over 30 drones<br />
-Hidden trap doors<br />
-Pointless locked doors<br />
-Many surfaceflow drones in mid-air. I could go on

<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/staples"">staples</a><br />
<br /><br /> 2.5/5<br />
This
map has Tumenydooorz(TMD) Syndrome. This means that you don't have to
get every switch to win. This map also clumps object a bit much. I
strongly dislike the use of launchpads in this map. Launchpads have
been placed in a perfectly wall-jumpable area which cause you to lose
control over where you are going. I do however like the use of
floorchasers in the top area.
<br />
<br /> Pros:<br />
-Nice use of floorchasers<br />
-Fairly good looking tileset<br />
-Fun mine jumper sections
<br />
<br /> Cons:<br />
-TMD and clumping<br />
-Badly placed mines<br />
-Out of the 11 doors only one is needed for an all gold completion<br />
-Bad use of launchpads
<br />
<br /> <br />

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/b-man"">b-man</a><br />
<br /><br /> 2.5/5<br />
Random
tiles do not make for a good level. This would be a 3 or 3.5 level if
there was some pattern to it but it all seems a bit off. The gold has
been placed at different patterns and the enemies are illogically
placed which makes this map off-balanced somehow. I did however really
enjoy playing it. It is a very fun map if you get it right.
<br />
<br /> Pros:<br />
-Fun<br />
-An exciting challenge
<br />
<br /> Cons:<br />
-Not playtested enough<br />
-Zap drone paths need to be spread out more<br />
-Random tiles
</p>
<br />
<p>That's
it. Thanks for the one great map: Black Dog Serenade by Infinitum and
Yahoozy
<br /> Back
to Mr. Kucharski.</p>
<br />
<p>
I'm going to keep that trend going. First person to comment gets to
email me about doing Random Rates. I'll make that a tradition.</p>"
40,"<p>As (I hope) you've heard, this will be the last
edition of The Sunday N done by me. If anyone else wants to pick it up,
contact maestro to see if you can get something organised, but don't
take this as a guarantee. I've had fun doing it, but it had started to
become a chore, and following a great ethic of Dave's, when something
becomes a chore that you have the choice to stop, don't do it any more.
So I'll bow out here with forty-one issues. I'm definitely pleased with
that amount. Also, expect a release of a userlevels file of all maps
that have made it in here at some point soon, from AMLT. The boy had
the good idea, and I, the other boy, gave it the A-OK.</p>

I bid you adieu.</p>

<h1>Artist
Commentary of the Third Kind<br>
</h1>
<p>I have
two for you this time. First up, community veteran <a
 href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/697328"">tktktk</a>!</p>
<p>
<em>Pluish &#8211; </em>I consider this to be my first decent map. It was, as
the name implies, inspired by maximo&#8217;s classic map, plue. I distinctly
remember being entirely frustrated with my relatively poor mapmaking
skills at the time. For my next attempt, I decided to use the basic
style and concept of plue as a starting point. I copied the general
style &#8211; the rockets, gold designs, and 45-degree tiles &#8211; but made the
gameplay itself much lengthier and more difficult.<br />
<br />
Like plue, the map has a good flow and is very open to different
routes. I spent a long time tweaking the tileset to maximize these
traits. Although maximo&#8217;s was far superior to mine, this map was an
important step for me in becoming the mapmaker I am today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Framework &#8211; In my opinion, my second good map. The theme of NC6 was
Metanet style, but in retrospect this doesn&#8217;t seem very much like a
Metanet map at all. Although this map did win NedCon 6, that&#8217;s not
really what makes it special to me. My intention in making it was to go
for something epic, and part of the way through development I came up
with the idea of using all nine enemy types. This aspect of the map is
cool and makes for a lot of diverse gameplay challenges, but the thing
that stands out about this map most is the incredible flow throughout
it.<br />
<br />
After designing the tileset and putting in the bounce blocks, I was
amazed at how easy it was to move around. Everything in the map fits
together in such a way that the player can move about easily in almost
any direction. Not only is the map not limited to a single route to
follow, but no particular method of completion presents itself over
another. There are a number of equally viable options immediately open
to the player from the very beginning.<em><br />
<br />
<br />
Simple Challenge #13 &#8211; </em>My goal in creating the Simple Challenge
series was to focus on testing the limits of the player&#8217;s ability
without having to deal with the restrictions of a regular map. I think
this particular iteration represents really well what the series is all
about: illustrating a single challenging gameplay concept in the most
basic way possible.<br />
<br />
The tiles are set up so that the player must walljump almost perfectly
in order to gain enough momentum to reach the goal. What I really like
about it is that it&#8217;s virtually uncheatable without requiring any other
mines or objects to block alternate routes. The only other plausible
option would involve a very tricky reverse corner jump, which would
take longer and be much harder to do than the actual challenge itself
anyway.<em><br />
<br />
<br />
Misconception &#8211; </em>I remember the first time I played Lucidium&#8217;s map
Deceptive, wondering what could possibly be so difficult about a map
with no enemies. Not only was I proven very wrong, but that was the map
that really gave me a love for no-enemy puzzlers.<br />
<br />
When I decided to make one of my own, I came up with the idea of using
one shape throughout the map. I used rounded tiles, in keeping with the
style of Deceptive, and the final result was a shape that could be used
in a lot of different ways. I tried to use every section of the shape
for some purpose at some point in the map, whether to help or hinder.
My favorite part of the map is the right uppermost switch, which
requires a running start and a jump off one of the rounded tiles,
because unlike some of the other jumps the solution does not
immediately present itself.<br />
<br />
<em><br />
Shrapnel &#8211; </em>Race maps are often too convoluted for my tastes; a lot
of them have so many elements that the flow is broken somewhere along
the line and aesthetics are practically nonexistent. As a result, in
making my own I decided to focus on flow while keeping things as simple
as possible. <em><br />
<br />
</em>I found that using only a few small fragments of tile was a good
way of doing that. It provides the player with challenge while adding
to the minimalist theme. The gold is there not so much to provide extra
challenge as to make the intended route more clear to the player. I
decided not to block off other ways of completing the map because it
would require a lot of mines that would detract from the effect I was
going for, and because the intended route is still the most efficient
one for all-gold. <em><br />
<br />
<br />
Revel &#8211; </em>I chose this map because I think it best represents the
good qualities of my old mini-challenges style. The map is broken up
into several individual sections, with a switch or some gold as the
incentive for each. Unlike some of my other maps in this style
(Structure, for example), I feel the challenges are very well
integrated and feel like a whole rather than a bunch of disconnected,
incoherent parts that happened to be thrown together.<br />
<br />
The floorguard and thwump sections are a good example of why this map
works well. If the player holds left from the beginnning, the thwump is
triggered automatically, giving them just enough time to swing around
for that extra gold before beating the thwump back into its corridor.
The oneways in the upper right are also pretty interesting. The player
is constantly tempted by the gold above each, yet the laser drone has a
strong tendency to fire at the most unfortunate moments. This forces
players to plan their jumps carefully so that the laser fires above or
below their intended route.<em><br />
<br />
<br />
Stratevasion &#8211; </em>From Legacy&#8217;s Expanse map pack. This map actually
started out as part of another Expanse map of mine, Cavern District.
However, upon playtesting it, the consensus among the other team
members was that the original map was too long and disjointed, so this
part was broken off and fleshed out into its own map.<br />
<br />
This map&#8217;s name is a portmanteau of the words &#8220;strategy&#8221; and &#8220;evasion&#8221;,
and the map requires plenty of both. Although the gameplay is rather
different, this map was inspired by the left portion of LV&#8217;s map
Convention, which is one of my all-time favorite map segments. The
three-drone setup not only provides the desired amount of difficulty,
but also feels more organic, as opposed to the structure and symmetry
of an even number of drones. I also like that the underground tube
running the length of the map gives players a bit more freedom in how
they complete it.<em><br />
<br />
<br />
Fantasy Check &#8211; </em>With my Minimalist Series I wanted to illustrate
the huge variety of maps that could be made in N by limiting myself to
only mines and gold as objects. I think Fantasy Check is a really good
representation of that.<br />
<br />
The tileset was done using all of the different tile types to create a
whimsical sort of structure. It&#8217;s hard to describe the feeling I get
from this map; it&#8217;s a very surreal experience. The lower part of the
hanging section gives the sense that the player is hanging
precariously, sort of moving in and out between danger and safety. The
bottom portion is really unique in a minimalist sort of way, and
although it doesn&#8217;t look like it, there are several ways to complete
it. In naming this map I thought about the phrase &#8220;reality check&#8221;, and
decided that the gameplay suggested exactly the opposite &#8211; a break from
reality to delve into a fantasy world.<em><br />
<br />
<br />
Rawkstar Central &#8211; T</em>his is one of my favorites from the Legacy
Origins map pack. I started out with this one messing around with the
design of the circles and continued building from there. The drones are
set up on two simple paths that make it surprisingly difficult to
collect the gold they&#8217;re protecting. What I like about the gauss on the
left is that it the player can hide from it in the little crevices
naturally created by the gaps in the tile circles.<br />
<br />
The section where the player climbs to trigger the trapdoors was
inspired by a similar part in stepself&#8217;s map Conflux. The climb and the
trapdoors themselves are, in my opinion, what really make the map
shine. The trapdoor on the left is meant for those who only want to
complete the map, while the one on the right is intended for more
experienced players who are going for some or all of the gold. By
allowing the choice between them, the map becomes more accessible to
different styles of play.<em><br />
<br />
<br />
Brambles and Shambles &#8211; </em>The final map of the Legacy Origins pack,
and a tough one at that. There was some debate among the team over
whether the map was too difficult and frustrating. At one point the
gauss turret at the top was going to be removed, but instead we opted
to make it the final level of the pack without watering down the
challenge of the map.<br />
<br />
I really love the aesthetics of this map. It&#8217;s done once again with
only one shape, and the pointiness of the tiles gives it a thorny sort
of look, while the emptiness of the upper two thirds of the map gives
it kind of a desolate feel. The gameplay itself is a blend of jumping
puzzles that originate from the tileset and mines and timing-oriented
action sequences that created by the drones and gauss. It all comes
together to make a really great, immersive experience and a memorable
end to the pack.</p>
<h1>And Artist Commentaire the Second, <a
 href=""http://pastebin.ca/raw/703140"">George</a>!</h1>
<p>
<em>The enemy below </em>- This was one of the first maps that I really
enjoyed making. I remember seeing one random level appear on the main
screen in N: 21-3 Evac. Upon seeing it, I went and mapped. This is the
result - I think this was the first 'good' map I ever made, with an
episodic quality to it.<br />
<br />
<em>Impulsive</em> - One day upon impulse, I opened up Ned, and I created
this. It was a somewhat krusch inspired. The difficulty balance of the
map was just perfect, making it accessible to players of all skill
levels.<br />
<br />
<em>He was ten</em>. - Honestly speaking, I'm still not completely
satisfied with this. KA might be, but I'm not. It's still a great map
nonetheless.<br />
<br />
<em>Precarious Movement</em> - Random names, FTW! I was delightfully
shocked to see how much attention it received. It was really my own
take on Jeffkillian's Desperado: three rockets, one gauss. One of my
favourite rocket dodgers of all time.<br />
<br />
<em>Travail </em>- &lt;3 Demonz's tiles.<br />
<br />
<em>Interregnum </em>- Sendy inspired thwumps and tiles, Palemoon
inspired gold. It worked perfectly. It's one of the few thwump oriented
maps I've made.<br />
<br />
<em>Tiempo</em> - This is definitely my favourite MNNM League entry ever.
I love this one to death. <br />
<br />
<em>Foul Dissonance</em> - Truth be told, at that point in time, I didn't
if I should continue making maps or not. I had run out of ideas,
totally blanked out. I lost the motivation to map, until I came up with
this. Not having made a proper puzzle map in a century, I set out and
gave it my all with this map. It took quite a bit of tweaking before I
was happy with it. Timing and precision are oh-so-important factors for
success. It also happens to be the only map where I've used an edited
launch pad.<br />
<br />
<em>Quark Parry</em> - The lasers are there to make sure you scale the
walls with care, and the floor guards and gauss make sure you don't
stay too still. It's one of my more difficult maps, but I find it very
rewarding every single time I reach the exit. You should, too.<br />
<br />
<em>Le Olde Style</em> - As the title suggests, I reverted back to my old
'rocket dodging' map style. By now I was a much more experienced making
than when I had my first twenty. The whole map was a slush of some of
my favourite mapping techniques, all blended into one healthy smoothee.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although a relatively late addition, I thought this was a cool idea.
Thanks for helping it to succeed, everyone who commentated.</p>
<h1>Random
Rates</h1>
<p>Again, a
late addition, and I'm sorry it didn't last any longer. Maybe
SlappyMcGee would like to migrate it to the forums or something?

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/funman"">funman</a> <br />
2.5/5<br />
<br />
I don't quite know what to make of this map. The description reads:
""show you the middle but know more :D rate :)"". Which nonsensical,
until you realised he's posted a demo of the ""mittile,"" which
demonstrates his method of getting to the door switch. At any rate,
there are, needless to say, a lot of mines in or on woot mountan. The
""oneways-amongst-mines"" idea is vaguely interesting, though not well
executed. Maybe it's my prejudice against mine jumpers, maybe it's the
map; either way, it didn't seem fun.<br />
<br />
The woot:<br />
- It's themed! I like a good theme. Rock-climbingish, with decent mine
placement.<br />
- It's possible.<br />
<br />
The rest:<br />
- Frustrating factor of 5.<br />
- Gold placement isn't terribly inspired.<br />
- The switch is useless.<br />
- That *%&amp;$ing mine above the exit. <br />
<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/67187"">tower o' power</a> by <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/megapwner"">megapwner</a><br />
1/5<br />
<br />
There is no power, and that is barely a tower. More importantly, there
is no fun. There's also that switch in the sky... Ugh. Thought may have
gone into this map, but I just don't get the desired intent. I finished
it on my first attempt, and thought ""Now what?"". I did again, slightly
faster, and felt no satisfaction. It's awkward and stupid.<br />
Power!<br />
- ... it's minimalistic? I got nothing.<br />
<br />
Power down:<br />
- Livens's glitch.<br />
- Boring.<br />
- Annoying<br />
- Pointless.<br />
- Next map already. <br />
<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/39465"">Take Your Time</a> by <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/LexusGT"">LexusGT</a><br />
2/5<br />
<br />
Oh, I've got plenty of time? Then I won't mind waiting for the freakin'
map to load. So. Many. Mines. And those sections are useless! Worse
than useless! That's a bad start. The game play is tedious, the enemies
inconsequential, and it's essentially the same thing four times. Can I
have a good map already?<br />
<br />
Worth your time:<br />
- It's pretty.<br />
<br />
Not worth your time:<br />
- It's pretty crap.<br />
- And the load-time sucks.<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/66978"">Saving Point</a> by <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/XChaosX"">XChaosX</a><br />
?/5<br />
<br />
... and the Random Rates Fates give me half a map. It's not a bad half,
admittedly, but it's still only half a map.... that looks a little like
a penis. I've seen most of these elements before in a race.
Interestingly, the flow wasn't immediately obvious to me, but I -liked-
that in this map. The bounce-back at the end is cool. Someone should
check out the finished version (assuming it exists).<br />
<br />
Saving graces:<br />
- Flowy! But not in a exceedingly linear way.<br />
- Successful use of jump pads.<br />
<br />
Points to be improved:<br />
- Well, a finish might be nice.<br />
- Moving away from the testicular theme (read: ovals).<br />
- Mines that you might actually hit.<br />

<br />
Woo! Blizzy map. Thank you, Oh God of Random Maps. The
sparse/scattered/Concentrate theme is nice. Though, gold makes it look
more cluttered than LV's original. I don't think it's generally as
successful as LV's, even aside from the fact that it's a tribute map.
Maybe it's the drone paths, or perhaps the switch placement. Still,
trib4almaniac's demo <del>demonstra</del>- illustrates how gracefully
such an awkward map can be traversed.<br />
<br />
Well fuck, now I&#8217;m stuck, as far as &#8220;clever&#8221; pros and cons titles go.<br />
Uh&#8230;<br />
<br />
Quantum plate!<br />
- You may bask in the glory of some Kablizzy-LittleViking love.<br />
- Plausible difficulty.<br />
- Enjoyable pacing.<br />
- A sense of accomplishment upon completion.<br />
<br />
Cunt template:<br />
- Borderline &#8220;whacking&#8221;. Did you find yourself asking the question, &#8220;Is
this expertly constructed, or thrown together?&#8221; Especially with the
gold.<br />
- The drone paths. They don&#8217;t seem to have the finesse of LV&#8217;s.<br />

<h1>Artist
Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>A personal favourite mapper of mine this week: <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/BuddyLee""><em>BuddyLee</em></a></p>
<p>
<a href=""http://pastebin.ca/raw/512975"">M.a.P.s.</a></p><br />
<p>
<em>Incline</em>: I made this one before I'd seen any Twipped-style
maps.&nbsp; It's more difficult than it looks.&nbsp; You know that time period
when you make a map you really like, and its feedback determines how
your day is?&nbsp; Yeah, this was my first pride-and-joy map.&nbsp; Sparked my
love of mapmaking.</p>
<p>
<em>Crooked Physics</em>: If I could only plug one map, this would be the
one.&nbsp; Spent hours(!) tweaking tiles and about the same time on
gameplay.&nbsp; This one will mess with your mind.&nbsp; And it won't cause a
hangover in the morning.</p>
<p>
<em>The Eccentric</em>: So I was playing around with Ned one day when I
heard a knock on the door accompanied by labored breathing.&nbsp; I
cautiously approached apprehenciously as a jolly green yeti jovially
leapt toward me!&nbsp; I then instinctively smote his ruin onto the dull
carpetry.&nbsp; Suddenly, a magic carpet burst through the window and swept
her and me from the miry slaughter.&nbsp; I whispered softly, ""don't you
dare close your eyes.&nbsp; Just wait, it gets better.""&nbsp; Noting the yeti's
poverty, we majestically arrived in Mexico City, seeking the yeti's
lair.&nbsp; Upon its discovery, I briskly strutted in to find the yeti's two
partners enjoying each other.&nbsp; I brazenly penetrated my steel rod deep
through their sleek, attractive sarapes.&nbsp; Then I found $5, thus
changing the mexican Fortune 4 into the Fortune 5, and made this map.</p>
<p>
<em>Set Ablaze</em>: The simple, suspended tileset here makes for
hardcore rocket dodging.&nbsp; It's great practice.</p>
<p>
<em>Mezzanine</em>: This took hours to determine whether the first part
was even possible.&nbsp; I loved the idea of riding a platform of thwumps,
dodging rockets and mines.</p>
<p>
<em>Anaetilus</em>: Toshosoft told me the top was far too boring/cliche.&nbsp;
The suggestion birthed the puzzle element you find in the map now.&nbsp; Its
inspiration stemmed from a life-changing spiritual journey.&nbsp; 'Twas a
bright and energetic day as my car approached the temple.&nbsp; Deep down, I
yearned for something -- an insatiable longing for life with Him.&nbsp; I
donned my temple garments and admired the purity of the ivory while
receiving my annointment.&nbsp; I then entered the most picturesque room
that ever graced my eyes.&nbsp; I then approached the veil -- a swirling,
gauzy masterpiece with a pure hand extending to greet me.&nbsp; At that
point, His hand demonstrated the sacred handshakes to grant me access
into His kingdom.&nbsp; I found $5 and made this map.</p>
<p>
<em>Sounds as Sweet as a Night of Surrender</em>: First and only one-way
puzzle map I've made.&nbsp; I wanted to make something with multiple paths
and directions and tricks and dead ends.&nbsp; Its NUMA acclaim tells me it
achieved that.</p>
<p>
<em>Twine</em>:This is a compact and tileset-based version of an airy
mine jumper.&nbsp; The idea hit me while vacationing in Buck Run,
Pennsylvania.&nbsp; During my morning jaunt through the forest I caught the
eye of a frothing moose!&nbsp; It proceeded to stare me down until I
instictively jettisoned myself toward my beach shack.&nbsp; I felt his warm
breath hot on my heels as its death-inducing eyes pierced through my
soul.&nbsp; I retreated to my humble lean-to where I took solace in my
safety, eating tacos with nothing but lettuce and cheese.&nbsp; And
chocolate.&nbsp; Then I made this map.</p>
<p>
<em>Standoff</em>: I made this one during a 5-hour flight.&nbsp; Aimed for
abstract, obscure figures; came out rather well I think.&nbsp; The gameplay
is as consistent as I could possibly make it.&nbsp; Midflight, though, I
glanced to my right to find a pregnant woman smiling back at me.&nbsp; A
sudden fear crept into her irises and seconds later, a gargantuan
wetness appeared and grew at her waist.&nbsp; As an answer to my quizzical
look, she exclaimed, ""my water has broken, as you can see by looking
down at my beautifully embroidered blouse! Could you please, dear sir,
do me a solid and assist me in the laborous duty of birthing my eighth
child?""&nbsp; To which I responded, ""of course, miss!"" and whipped out my
portable subwoofer to bust out an infectious beat to reassure the
mother.&nbsp; The rest of the passengers began to get jiggy wit it ""Soul
Plane"" style as I safely delivered the baby.&nbsp; After the commotion, this
magnum opus and map were created.</p>
<p>
<em>The Ceiling's So Impeding</em>: So I was in bed early one night, when
suddenly this concept hit me like the clouds parting and the living
godhead telling it like it is.&nbsp; I raced out of bed and worked on it for
a few hours straight.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she got up, dressed, and left.</p>
<br />
<p>Don' forget to toon in next week!</p>

Now, a larger sample space would give a more accurate reading, such as
this week's maps. So now, I have for you, some better statistics.
(These are all averages.) If your map gets in The Sunday N, it will
have no increase in actual rating, but will have an extra four point
two ratings. You will be given zero point seven more comments, and zero
point two more demos.</p>

<p>
Well, well, well, well. If it isn't fat, stinking billygoat Billy-Boy
in poison. How art thou, thy globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil?
Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch
jelly thou. <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Slappy_McGee""><em>SlappyMcGee</em></a>.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Greetings and salutations, ladiekins and gentlemanlies.
Tonight I have with me the ravishing and radiant <em>SlappyMcGee</em>.
How are you, Slaps?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee: </strong>I'm decent, thanks for permitting me entrance to
this veritable forest of <em>Nterview</em>. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> 'Twas and continues to be a pleasure. Tell me: In your
comparatively short stay with the Metanet community, you've done as a
little as is humanly possible not to contribute anything to this
community. How's that workin' out for ya?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee: </strong>Pretty damn well, actually. Contributing nothing
sets a benchmark no other can achieve. I'm most proud that I've
contributed so little, and still manage to be the undeniably Prettiest
member of Metanet. Nonetheless, I am planning to break this streak soon
enough. I have some things on the horizon. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner: </strong>So, you haven't really done nothing as such. You had a
webcomic, <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=13602"">Exxon
Lane</a>,
that had some promise until you abandoned it. Can you tell us what
inspired that?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee:</strong> It was inspired by things like <<a
 href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0118715/"">The Big Lebowski</a>,
movies or books whose plot doesn't matter. I really loved that comic,
but time constraints only allowed me to do three before accidentally
throwing away the script I had written. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner: </strong>So there was a plan? You weren't just making it up as
you went along?< />
<strong>SlappyMcGee: </strong>No, no. The first story arch was planned to last
til' about Mid-Summer in a weekly comic, and then I would conclude it
and continue the comic as a more adventurey deal. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/BigBlargh"">BigBlargh</a> and yourself used to be each others' halves. Why? Is there some sort of
torrid love affair that we should know about?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee: </strong>I believe it was the second time I joined IRC that
blarghy approached me, knowing I was knew. He warned me that everybody
on this site was regular, sane persons who had infatuations with Penii.
I handled this well, and he agreed to be my half. That kind of fell
apart when I quit this site in January. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner: </strong>Those were dark days, indeed. Do you think your
nationality has had any effect on your status throughout the Metanet
community?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee: </strong>Oh, almost definitely. I think people don't take
me as seriously. When I start swearing at stupid jerks on IRC, it's
always handled very well. ""Sure, he's a prick, but he's Canadian."" It's
also provided us with a Merlin/King Arthurian sort of Canadian Bond. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner: </strong>I just figured that, since all you do is dick around,
it must have been the association with Mare and Raigan that got you
noticed. But then I remembered your incredible physique. You're quite a
movie buff. Is there a particular film that you associate with N and
the assorted other projects?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee: </strong>Well, I think the forums and IRC have a certain <a
 href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0000416/"">Gilliam</a> way about them,
like <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0088846/"">Brazil</a> or <a
 href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0120669/"">Fear and Loathing</a>.
But the game itself would definitely be <a
 href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0102034/"">Highlander Two</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> ""There can only be one Ninja!"" Will Sabrina read this?<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee:</strong> I am going to her house tomorrow, so Yes. You can
be pretty much sure she will. She claims she doesn't know what Metanet
or N is, but she's a total liar. </p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Thanks for stopping by, SlappyMcGee.<br />
<strong>SlappyMcGee:</strong> Thanks, thanks. I just mean to mention to be on the
lookout for The director's cut of African American Dentist Skytrain
Racing Extreme Deluxe Gold Edition. </p>
<br />
<p>
As though we needed to be told. nevermore, AKAed by some as <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/nevermore""><em>Linus</em></a>,
is lined up for next week. I hope to give it to him in the yarbles.</p>"

<h1>Artist
Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>This week we have with us one of my favourite mappers, as you will see
in the next article, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/lord_day""><em>lord_day</em></a>.</p>
<p><a
 href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/551785""><strong>The Maps</strong></a></p>
<br />
<p>I've chosen ten maps that I thought stood out for me as a map maker or
that I just really liked.&nbsp; I've listed them in chronological order:</p>
&nbsp;<p>
<em>Flought </em>- In my opinion, this was my first good map!&nbsp; I really
made an effort here to mix aesthetics with the central theme of flying.
Looking back on it, there are things I would change, but I am mainly
hapy with it.&nbsp; I was so proud of this map when I first made it, and
still enjoy playing it.&nbsp; I really think it was the map that set me in
motion.</p>
&nbsp;<p>
<em>09-1: Plant </em>- This map was my favourite I made from the
orgingal Echo pack, and another of my good early maps.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
alot of people don't like this map as much as I do, but I never really
minded.&nbsp; It is tricky, yet looks visually pleasing and mixes puzzle
elements with race elements. It's&nbsp; the first move up into the key that
really made this level for me.&nbsp; From there I just built outwards trying
to keep the circular theme going, and giving the map grace and flow, in
a way which I had never achieved before that point in time.</p>
&nbsp;<p>
<em>Outside</em> - The idea for this map just hit me once, and as soon as
I could I started building it.&nbsp; I had it planned all in my mind, but it
took alot of work to get the difficulty gradient right.&nbsp; In all my maps
I make, I start in one place and build out from there.&nbsp; I never build a
tileset first then add objects, and this map is a prime example, as I
started in the bottom left corner and snaked my way around the map.&nbsp; It
gave me the first taste of the power of oneways, like no other map I
had made/played before did. After I made this map, I saw a whole bunch
of oneway glitch maps, and I would like to think that I was the
cause/blame for that. ^_^</p>
&nbsp;<p>
<em>The Death of Suspense </em>- While on my oneway high, I played
stepself's fantastic Sandstone (Hopewell) for about the bajillion'th
time, and thought about making a similar map but with layers.&nbsp; At the
same I had sketched out ideas for a map that zigzaged up and down the
map from one side to the other.&nbsp; Turn the latter on it's side, fuse the
two ideas together and spend about 5 hours mapping one sleepless
night,and you end with The Death of Suspense.&nbsp; To get this to work, I
first made the map out of E tiles, one ways and enemies, stretched it
to fit the whole screen, then finally carved and moulded the rest of
the map to give it the right feel, while placing the rest of the
objects to perfection...&nbsp; Phewww, it took more effort than some of my
DDA's. :0</p>
<p>
<em>00-3: Meet the Thwump</em> - And so began the completed column.&nbsp; 50
maps later and this one is still my joint favourite from the pack.&nbsp; I
rarely make simple levels that are good, but this is one of those times
where I think that I really succeeded.&nbsp; It all kind of gels together,
bringing an easy level for beginners in with two nifty ways of
completing a little puzzle.</p>
<p>
<em>08-2: Scarlet Starlet</em> - My other favourite from the completed
column, and the complete oppisite end of the thwump puzzle spectrum.&nbsp; A
tricky puzzle with complex mechanics.&nbsp; My favourite type of map!&nbsp; This
one was not easy to get working, but the end result is awesome.</p>
<p>
<em>Pull the level.&nbsp; Make a move. </em>- Another level that just gels.&nbsp;
I've always found seeker drones hard as hell to control, and this map
is my best efforts at controlling drones, with good gameplay to boot.&nbsp;
Levels with good seeker drone paths have always impressed me, and I was
hoping to do the same to others with this map.&nbsp; The idea for the left
side was to make an area that wasn't hard to get out of, but might be
tricky to find a real speedy route.&nbsp; Some people found that boring.<p>Oh
well.</p>
<p>
<em>Warning Chimpanzees FTW!</em> - This map came from my guest episode
in Borealis' awesome 'Ved Buens Ende'.<p>Not only does this map make me
laugh, it is actually really fun. The rocket dodging action is pretty
extreme here if you are going for a fast all gold demo, and I really
like the look that this map portrays. This map may not be one of my
best, but I really smile everytime I play it.</p>
<p>
<em>Thousand Million </em>- Simple idea, cool looking and extremely
fun.<p>I really like this one.<p>No more to be said.</p>
<p>
<em>08:Tarantula</em> - As a map from the most recent project I helped
work on, Session 4, I thought that this one really stood out from my
maps.<p>I spent along time testing different ideas, spent along time
messing around with tiny details of the map, and you would not believe
how many different forms this map went through. It's supposed to be a
little scary and very tense.<p>I think it works really well.<p>Those
chainguns are gonna get ya'!</p>
<br />
<p>
Big hand for the man. I'll have someone new for you next week.</p>
<h1>Top
Ten NUMA Authors</h1>
<p>
Alright, I remember promising this for you guys a while ago, and I
never really bothered to get down to it. I've got quite a bit of time
now, so I thought I'd hit you up with another list. I'm guessing some
of all of these will be pretty obvious, but I'm just trying to provide
a bit of reading. Have fun!</p>
<h2>#10 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/yahoozy_Guacamole"">yahoozy_Guacamole</a></h2>
<p>
As I'm sure most of you know, I used to be a real hater
of yahoozy's maps. From his very beginning to about the middle of his
mapmaking career, frankly, I hated him. He made about twenty million
maps a week, and they all had the exact same qualities. That irked me
to no end. After that phase, he went on to make what some people will
label as 'abstract maps', but which I see as piled of junk. That phase
was no good either. However, following this phase, he finally grew up
as a mapmaker, and made lots of lovely linear maps, which you've seen
in the last five or ten Sunday Ns. His mapmaking has increased in
quality generously, and therefore, I award him number ten.</p>
<h2>#9 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/astheoceansblue"">astheoceansblue</a></h2>
<p>
atob detractors tend to focus on the fact that, really, his style
hasn't changed in years. I mainly counter this with the fact that
although he's made a ton of maps, all of which incorporate his famous
style, the quality of his maps has not fallen at all in this time. He
still finds new and innovative ways to use his tilesets, even though
they might look similar, and have the same feel. I also suppose that
the fact that I really like the style he has helped him to get number
nine.</p>
<h2>#8 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Barabajagal"">Barabajagal</a></h2>
<p>
Everyone knows Baraba as one of the mapmaking mainstays of the Metanet
community. His consistent approach to good mapmaking, and introduction
of fantastic innovations allowed me to offer him a place in The
Camisade Collection, which I consider the apex of his and my mapmaking
careers. Even though he did delete all his maps at one point, most (if
not all) were recovered, and people continue to enjoy his maps since.
He still posts the odd map occasionally, and they're just as good as he
ever was. Round of applause for our number eight, everyone.</p>
<h2>#7 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/9400"">9400</a></h2>
<p>
Well, 9400's been a friend of mine ever since he joined the community;
some might say he's joined my upper eschelon. Even so, my enjoyment of
his mapmaking is not biased based on our friendship at all.
His mapmaking career has been (relatively) short, but his
output fantastic. His almost cubist approach to mapmaking brings a new
style into the spectrum, and his use of linearity is something I admire
greatly.And so I hand over to him number seven.</p>
<h2>#6 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Sendy"">Sendy</a></h2>
<p>I find it slightly incongruous that one of the mapmakers on NUMA with
such a high total output could continue to come up with new, complex,
and insanely difficult ideas, even to this day. Sendy has somehow
pulled it off. She's notorious for her use of what some might call
over-the-top difficulty, but I just consider another aspect to her
maps. It really makes them a challenge to play, and again for some,
maybe even a challenge to enjoy. That said, it's not a challenge for
me, and Sendy's brilliant use of all aspects of the N editor gets her
number six.</p>
<h2>#5 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/krusch"">krusch</a></h2>
<p>
Again, another fantastic friend of mine, indeed my best friend on this
fine Earth, whose mapmaking ability is absolutely phenomenal; on a
level some also might call 'abstract', but I call 'krusch'. There's
definitely a good reason krusch had a link to his maps on the NUMA
sidebar for a day, and it doesn't involve buttsex. Much. His entirely
innovative and smooth style lends his maps an air of superiority, which
I will gladly accept as the truth. So that's why he's the first of the
top five.</p>
<h2>#4 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/AMomentLikeThis"">AMomentLikeThis</a></h2>
<p>I thought about including MasterJmd in this as well, but really, AMLT's
earlier maps under that alias weren't nearly as good as his output with
this one. Another fine mapmaker with a huge number of submissions, some
short, some long, some middling, AMLT is definitely one of the most
innovative authors around. He makes maps the likes of which I've never
seen before, and probably won't see again. And then he makes another
five maps that day. I just don't understand how that's possible, but
obviously it is, and that clinches number four.</p>
<h2>#3 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/blue_tetris"">blue_tetris</a></h2>
<p>Mr Tetris. The puzzle author of a new millenium. Seriously, Dave'll be
around when 3000 rolls around. You just wait, fools. Discoverer (and
exploiter) of more thwumps tricks than is humanly possible, Dave's one
of the most consistently brilliant mappers around. I'd that that.
Number three.</p>
<h2>#2 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/lord_day"">lord_day</a></h2>
<p>I remember when I first played one of lord_day's maps in a little map
pack whose name I can't recall, and it blew me off my feet. It was
nothing I'd ever seen before. And it wasn't even in the style he
carries on these days. I knew he was destined for greatness, and I even
told krusch so. Lo and behold, here we are today with one of the best
mapmakers of all time creating masterpieces out of thin air.
Unfortunately, all his mapmaking at the moment is going towards a pack,
so he hasn't done much on NUMA recently, but what he has done in the
past is absolutely exemplary. Absolute exemplariness will get you
number two.</p>
<h2>#1 - <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/LittleViking001"">LittleViking</a></h2>
<p>What can I say? Kevin's a god. His very first map ever is absolutely
fun to play, and every single map he's made since has been absolutely
fun to play. His maps mightn't look too flashy, but the gameplay is
better than Metanet. I have no qualms with saying that. If he were
recruited to create new episodes for 1.5, the game could not be any
better. Not only are his maps brilliant, he has pioneered both
teleporters andthe idea of user episodes. The LV Chronicles are
famously the very first of their kind, and are, in my eyes, some of the
finest creations ever to come out of Ned. So with that, everyone send
your hearty congratulations to the big man, 'cause he fucking deserves
them. Number one.</p>
<br />
<p>
I hope y'all enjoyed that little trip through my mind. It's fun in
here, i'nnit?</p>
<p>
I might do another top ten some time soon, so keep your eyes out!</p>

<p>By Tanner Rogalsky</p>
<br />
<p>""I try to be candid in
interviews...but I've learned that whenever you try and make a point
about anything, you always end up sounding like a douchebag."" - Owen
Pallett</p>
<p><em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/nevermore"" title=""nevermore"">nevermore</a>
</em>has been around a lot longer than most people but you'd hardly
know it from talking with him. It's hard to imagine that such a laid
back guy could have made as frantic a map as <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/7471"" title=""Tattletale"">Tattletale</a>.
He's a moderator on the forums and a half-op on the IRC. I once read on
the forums that his favourites were a good representation of NUMA
without the crap. His thoughts on maps and the like are VERY LARGE!
Oonce.</p>
<p><strong>Tanner:</strong>
Linus, you are counted among the original ranks of the <em>Legacy Team</em>.
How were you approached to join this most prestigious of organisations?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> It was all very understated, really. Back when <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/maximo"" title=""maximo"">maximo</a> </em>was
more of a presence on NUMA and the forums, he caught me on IRC. ""You're
cool,"" he told me. He explained the project. I was confused. ""Do you
want me in, or do you just want me to watch?"" I asked. I was insecure
because of emotional scarring. ;_.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What's it like working with in a group with <em>maximo</em>,
<em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/littleviking001""
 title=""LittleViking001"">LittleViking001</a></em>, <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/tktktk"" title=""tktktk"">tktktk</a></em>,
<em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/sweep"" title=""sweep"">sweep</a>
</em>and <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/kablizzy""
 title=""Kablizzy"">Kablizzy</a></em>.<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> It's very touchy-feely. We say ""man"" a lot
after sentences. It's cool, though. We feel good about ourselves. Most
of the guys are totally cool dudes, man. And awesome map makers, I
learn a lot from them. Pretty mature for the most part as well.
Interesting group, really. Everyone has their own little touches that
they add to the group. We're all pretty eccentric, as well. Most people
don't understand us. We're tortured souls, actually.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> You spend a lot of time on NUMA. What's your
philosophy when it comes to rating maps?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> I don't like modern maps, for the most part.
They're so boring. Very hip, following little style affectations that
don't do it for me at all. But give me a <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/stepself"" title=""stepself"">stepself</a>
</em>map, an LV map, and I go wild. So really, in general I ignore
looks. I'm much more drawn to simpler looks, though, so that might
affect which maps I play in the first place. I rate almost entirely on
how much fun I have playing a map. I guess it varies depending on mood,
but that's not my problem. ^.^</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Do you think the functionality of NUMA has
improved since <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/maestro""
 title=""maestro"">maestro</a> </em>and <em>sweep</em> took control of
it?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> Sure, it improved. Bitesized NUMA is brilliant.
They're great at weeding out multi-accounters. And for at least a brief
period of time, people were really critiquing and rating maps the way
they should be. Then again, there was something innocent about NUMA in
the early <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/arachnid""
 title=""Arachnid"">Arachnid</a> </em>years. I was recently going
through a thread in which people rated metanet maps, and the ratings
were <em>horrible</em>. Which I didn't really understand - how can our
standards for maps be so different from the creators of the game? I
came to the conclusion that we're silly to look for anything but what
is fun. But short answer, in some ways yes, in some ways no. We're
always going to have foolish people, and that's fine. I hate to be one
of those complainers about NUMA. <em>Sweep</em> and <em>maestro</em>
did a great job.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> How does playing every NUMA map affect how you
make your own maps?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> Aha, funny question. I don't do that anymore.
But I used to, at least until my computer stopped working with NUMA
maps. In any case, having that experience gives me a nice perspective,
I think. I try so hard not to latch onto little stylistic constructs
and affectations that make maps old and unoriginal. I may not be so
successful at shaving off all of that, but at least I have that
awareness. Being aware of something is good. I like to be self-aware,
especially about my emotional scarring. ;_.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/47970""
 title=""Elighten""><em>Enlighten</em></a> is such an interesting and
unique map. What was the thought process behind it?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> In retrospect, it was TOTALLY PRETENTIOUS. But
it was fun to make it. I liked mocking existentialism. Looking at the
world through a peephole, was the idea behind the map. I guess
subconsciously I wanted to go on an experimental flight of fancy with
the style in the map, and not have to suffer gameplay repercussions.
Stupid, I know. Same with the second map like that, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/58763"" title=""Isaac""><em>Isaac</em></a>.
I was just tired of worrying about so many things while making levels.
So I just had fun with design. I still like the way <em>Enlighten</em>
looks, and it actually doesn't play too badly. Too bad I probably can't
resubmit it. How unhip of me that would be! And everyone knows I like
to be a hip cat.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What is a map to you? Is it art, a level in a
ninja game, or something in between?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> I guess somewhere in between. Originality is
important to me, just like it is in art, but as I've said earlier
gameplay is the be all end all. The WORST thing for me is seeing people
copying <em><a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/astheoceansblue""
 title=""astheoceansblue"">astheoceansblue</a> </em>and <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/unconditional"" title=""Unconditional"">Unconditional</a>
</em>and the sort. They have a cool style, but it's interesting because
it's their own. The design of a level is nothing more than a mode of
reaching a certain level of fun to me.<p>It's like if you were in a
playground and instead of slides there were long paintings. And you
slid down them. Except it would be fun, and it wouldn't be bumpy.
That's just like N. The design is simply for fun, but one can put as
much as they'd like artistically into it. I try not to take myself too
seriously, though. That's pretty bad, too. When people attempt to be
hip, end up with a pretty stupid map, and then act totally pretentious
about it. I guess I'm just describing myself while making <em>Enlighten</em>.
But... Well, damn. I am. That's a new life goal of mine, though. To
never take myself too seriously.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Which is your favourite art-form? Music,
visual or dramatic?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> Eh, that's tough. Musical experiences seem to
be more spiritual than visual art. Making music with other people is an
experience of harmony and working together, and I love that. But visual
art is more interesting of a form of expression for me. It's more
reliant on someone's perception of the world. People can absorb
everything they experience, process it, and put their own entirely
unique spin on things. That's a great thing, to be able to exaggerate
and warp things in the world according to perception. I also love films
- great movies can really transplant into you a certain feeling. It's
almost like the overall product of movies represent the art of
emotions. They can take you on real roller coaster rides of emotion in
a way that nothing else really can. I suppose music can come close, but
not as dramatically so for me. They all have their upsides, I guess.
I'm into a whirlwind of the three, a whimsical, flight of fancy world
of art in which people follow whatever they'd like to do that day.
These days, though, I'm focusing on creating more visual art than
anything else.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Do you have a particular artist or group of
artists who inspire you the most?<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong> Not exactly. I like Cubism's approach to
things, and the artists' idea that nothing is static. That interests
me, as well as the idea that the perspective we see may not be
universal. How much of perspective is defined by knowledge of the world
around us? I also like Matthew Barney's <em>Cremaster</em> series.
Interesting stuff, I think. I love Kate Winslet, I think she's
beautiful. But really, I'm just naming people and things off the top of
my head. I don't have any particular favorite.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Awesome. Thanks for your time, Linus.<br />
<strong>Linus:</strong>Most definitely.</p>"

Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>On a
rather spur of the moment gesture, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Borealis""><em>Borealis</em></a>!</p>
<br />
<p><a
 href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/573858""><strong>Mups</strong></a></p>
<br />
<p>Just
so you guys know, these aren't in any particular order. I can't judge
my own work in any order.</p>
<p>
<em>Face In A Night-Time Mirror (Pt. 1)</em>: I really like this one.
It's probably one of the more simplistic tilesets, but it lends itself
to the gameplay fairly well. The object placement could be better, mnid
that rocket launcher is deviously placed. There's nothing more I like
than catching people out. RAWR.<br />
<br />
<em>I command thee, Skullgaffer!</em>: Well I can't really say much about
this, other than I really like it. As you know, me and IAABH did a vent
map each on IRC. We both conformed to the rules (well...sorta) but our
outcomes were almost completely different. This map is very metanet-y,
it's a MetaMap as Matt calls them, with a little of my own style
somewhere in there, I dunno. I really enjoy playing it.<br />
<br />
<em>pondering (Psychosis)</em>: The idea for this map came to me while I&nbsp;
was in the shower, looking at the u-bend pipe of my toilet. Sure,
artistic inspiration can come from better places! But that definitely
subscribes to Metanet's philosophy of looking around the environment
for tileset ideas. I hadn't really done a 'zoned' map in a while as
well, so when you combine these together it's a good mixture, I think.<br />
<br />
<em>You won't last a second out there on the battlefield, son.</em>: I
really enjoy doing collabs, so me and Mr_Mongoose jumped at the
oppurtunity when collaboration maps were a fairly new thing. Collab
maps really only work when the styles of the authors blend together,
and after lots of bouts of tweaking we managed to get something really
fun to play out of it.<br />
<br />
<em>Weightless and Horizontal</em>: This map for me at least really
signifies the jump in my style, from the abstract-but still
metanet-like levels of my earlier maps and the work in Ved Buens Ende
to my current fun-but-weird thang I have goin' on. Again, this map
definitely features 'zones', and each zone you need to be in in order
to collect a door switch. It's linear in that way, but still fairly
open. I was going to originally try for an MTI type thing, but the song
I was listening to at the time gave me the idea for the distinct zones,
like the song has distinct sections. I really like the look of this map
as well.<br />
<br />
<em>Celestial Peace</em>: I tried going on a minimalism bent for this
one. Even though the map is so very open, which some would call wasted
space I guess, there is a bit of linear-ness to it. It's also clear
where you have to go. Very fun to slam into the launch pads as well and
see the ninja fly across the level. ^-^<br />
<br />
<em>wither</em>: I thoght I'd like to incorporate an older level into
this as well, and this one stood out for me. It's really-Meta-Map, this
one, with the absolute symmetry of the tileset and objects, and even
though it's not up to the calibre of some of my newer levels it's still
play-worthy, and I still like the look of the chandelier in the middle.<br />
<br />
<em>Let's get ready to Bumble!</em>: It's a bee! What's not to like?<br />
<br />
<em>Interface to God</em>: Another golden oldie, mebbe? The tileset isn't
much to look at, but this map was where I started to buck up my ideas a
bit and think of the gameplay. I still think to this day that those
laser drones are in the best position they could be.<br />
<br />
<em>bl&aacute;skj&aacute;r</em>: Another fun-times-linearity map, perhaps a little too
awkward, I don't know. I like the look of this map though, and I think
I used the trampolines fairly well. My tilesets have always been better
than my object placement, but expect to see a change in that in ""Av
Buens Begynner""! &lt;/advertisement&gt;<br />
<br />
I hope this wasn't too boring for you. &lt;(^_^)&gt; [smilies make it
all better.]
<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By Tanner Rogalsky</p>
<p> I think it's sort of funny, albeit not altogether unexpected, how a
mapmaker's style is reflected in his or her interview. <em><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/LouDog004"" title=""LouDog"">LouDog</a></em> is the definition of a minimalist. All skillz,
no frillz. <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/5353"" title=""Cornered"">Cornered</a>.</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>How would you describe your mapping
style?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>Simple geometric tiles with the minimal amount of
objects that create a specific challenge. I almost always try to make
maps that I want to play with excessive use of the enter key.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner: </strong></span>Who is your
favourite author on NUMA and why?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/9400"" title=""9400"">9400</a>. His
enemy placement is impeccable. There's never some drone where you
think, ""Well, that doesn't make much sense,"" or ""That would have gone
better there."" And the enemies work well the first time you play
through, and when you try to go fast, and when you're just mucking
around.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner: </strong>Why are you less active in the community than
you used to be?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>I really just don't have that many ideas for maps
anymore, and a lot of the people I'm familiar with aren't around
anymore. Also, NUMA has gotten a little too cool for school in my mind.
I think what I derive joy from in N is a lot different than a lot of
newer members.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>What is it about 10 minute maps that
appeals to you?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>It's a fun challenge. If you put limits on your
mapping, you're forced to expand your ability. You don't have time
generally to be clever or gimmicky, and you just have to use enemies in
ways you know they'll work. You can't change your mind so you have to
stick with your original plan. That means you might make a map you
would otherwise have never seen.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>You also made 60 second maps. How do you
approach or prepare to make such a quick map?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>E tiles are your friend. :) Basically, just try to
create something that will constitute a usable tileset, and then hope
you can place objects to make a fun linear map. It's really not much of
a skill.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>How important do you think an
overarching style is to mapping?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>Completely irrelevant. I don't think it will help or
hinder someones mapmaking.<br />
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>Do you support the use of drugs to
influence artistic creations?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>More power to you if you can actually create something
fun. I've tried to map under the influence and it's never gone well.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>Have you submitted anything to SUBLiME?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>Yes, I'm hoping I can muster up something more.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner: </strong>Do you have any plans for the future
involving Metanet?<br />
<strong>LouDog: </strong>Oh, once there's some more information on the release
of Robotology, I may try to start some sort of event for people to win
a copy.</p>"

Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>Number
somethin' good on my favourite NUMA Authors, <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/AMomentLikeThis""><em>AMLT</em></a>!</p>
<p>
<a href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/601703"">And here are his maps.</a></p>
<p>
<em>Moonlight Shining Through</em>: This is
one of the first maps I've made in a while that hasn't been based upon
anyone elses. It started off as a flowwy box map, but after I'd
finished making the tileset I just had to make it longer. <br />
<br />
<em>Kiwi Fruit</em>: After
using a rather sexy one-way concept in '<a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/83410"">Cone Shaped Paradox</a>',<font
 face=""Times New Roman, Times, serif""> I just
had to expand on it.<br />
<br />
<em>Everyone Loves A Drama</em>: This
started the ninja right at the top, and the exit where the ninja is
now. It was something I made to test out my jumping skills. When I
accidently clicked edit instead of reset, I moved the exit, and decided
to play it backwards (the way it is now). After adding a few more
objects I was very impressed by it. <br />
<br />
<em>Nadia</em>: A 5
minute masterpiece. This map is so simple, yet so fun.<br />
<br />
<em>Girl In The Shadows</em>: Originally
made for the Best Small Race Competition, I really loved this. Once you
get the flow, you can really appreciate this map, especially for its
size.<br />
<br />
<em>The Full Ordeal</em>: I really
hate making DDAs, but I had quite a lot of fun with this one, it pretty
much made itself. I didn't really like the tileset at the time, but I
thought it'd make a pretty nice DDA, and with that in mind, I made one.
<br />
<br />
<em>Throwback Boulevarde</em>: This was
the first map I submitted as AMomentLikeThis (after making my last
MasterJmd map). It really is all about the tileset for me.<br />
<br />
<em>The Girl I'll Never Meet</em>: Originally
designed as the last map I'd ever make, The Girl I'll Never Meet was
made whilst feeling many mixed emotions. The tileset is also what
really makes this for me, it was the 'in thing' of the time to use 2
and 3 tiles to make 'thorn' style maps. I took that one step further by
using 6 and 7 tiles. Alltogether the map took me more than 2 hours to
make, constantly tweaking the object and tile placement until I felt
everything was perfect. An all gold on this would be amazing. <br />
<br />
<em>I Will Not Be Scared By Your Thoughtless Scheming</em>: This one took
me a while to make. Before I'd made it, it was the kind of tileset I'd
always wanted to make but could never quite get it right. When I'd
finally finished it, I was very impressed. <br />
<br />
<em>Tile 7</em>: The 'Tile' series of mine was what initially put me in
the spotlight. I made one, and people seemed to like it, by that I mean
someone gave it a 5, (which was extremely high compared with my
previous standards). Tile 7, although really basic, is in my view the
best one from the series. <em><br />
</em><br />
<br />
Tune in next week for someone! It's becoming harder and harder for me
to find people for this, considering I spend most of my time on the
IRC. If there's anyone reading this who thinks I'd like to give them a

<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By Tanner Rogalsky<//p>
<p> I really doubt if <a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/lord_day""
 title=""lord_day""><em>lord_day</em></a> needs an introduction. If you
don't know who lord_day is, scroll up. See those pretty numbered links
with the pound sign at the beginning at the top of the page? Click on
pretty much any one of those and you'll find a map by this guy. There's
some important stuff in this interview.&nbsp;It's pretty rock. <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/62229"" title=""Outside"">Outside</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> You make a lot of maps and participate in
an almost unparalleled number of map packs. Do you ever worry that
you'll simply run out of ideas someday?<br />
<strong>lord_day:</strong> Sometimes I get that fear, but not too
often.&nbsp; There are so many unexplored ideas for levels, and so when I do
run out of ideas I just make maps that are interesting in some way or
another, be it a new look or a new object combination. Also, playing
through large numbers of maps helps me think.&nbsp; Sometimes I will see
what an author hasn't done in a map, and make my map out of what is
missing in their map.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> You've been in nine map packs so far. Which
has been your favourite map pack from the ones you've participated in?<br />
<strong>lord_day:</strong> Oh boy, that is a tough question.&nbsp; I think
my favourite map to participate in was <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=16643""
 title=""Session 4""><em>Session 4</em></a>, which was just me and
rocket_thumped, trading maps and working real close together.&nbsp; We were
a real team, and the time spent making that pack was awesome.&nbsp; However,
my pack with which I am most pleased with is my solo pack, <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=13906""
 title=""the completed column""><em>the completed column</em></a>.&nbsp;
Making 50 levels by yourself is extremely satisfying, and&nbsp;I explored
many different aspects of map making in that pack.&nbsp; I really evolved as
a map maker through it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> When you make a map, do you just sit down and
say, ""I'm going to make a map."" or does there have to be inspiration?<br />
<strong>lord_day:</strong> When I sit down to make a map, I always have
something planned out in my head, I don't like to stumble blindly into
NED and just see what comes out.&nbsp; Perhaps that's why my ten minute maps
aren't great. However the degree I have it planned out to depends.&nbsp;
Sometimes I have the whole map in my mind, and sometimes I just have a
little area planned out, and it evolves from there. I also think that's
why I'm not very good at using pre-made tilesets.&nbsp; I like to place my
objects and tiles together, so that I have full control of how it all
works.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Do you ever completely abandon maps?<br />
<strong>lord_day:</strong> I do abandon quite a lot of maps, but it's
rare for me to abandon a map that I finish.&nbsp; Usually if I am going to
abandon it, I can tell before it is half complete.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What are three things you always keep in the
back of your mind while you are mapping?<br />
<strong>lord_day:</strong> I'd say number one, is that it's enjoyable
to play. I think most map makers keep that in mind, however some
people sometimes are so concerned with making aesthetically pleasing
maps it clouds this idea.
</p>
<p> Number two would be that I need keep thinking critically about my
maps. I ask myself 'Is that idea really cool?' or 'Is that actually
fun to play?' It's easy to fool yourself into thinking that your map
is really good, when it's not. I've play tested a lot of maps, and
most of the time the bit I think is the worst is what the author thinks
is the best bit of their map, and I always feel that they are pulling
the wool over their own eyes.<br />
</p>
<p> Numberthree is that it looks good. This may seem like it's
contradicted number one, but it's not. A map can be fun to play, and
look beautiful; there is nothing better than playing a fun, good
looking map. A good looking map subconsciously signals to the player
that the author knows what he is doing, and it makes them feel that
they are in safer hands.
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> What real-world skills does it take to be
a good map maker?<br />
<strong>lord_day:</strong> I think there are two obvious things that
help. Firstly, as I said before, being able to think critically about
your work is important. Looking down as a third person can really help
you in real life as well as NED. I also think that if you want to get
your name on the map, you need perseverance. You will not become known
as a good map maker over night,and I'm sure many map makers had to
just keep on trucking through NUMA until they were recognised.

<br />
<p>
<em>Barbed Wire</em>: After sort of a puzzle spree, this one really felt
like I banged out something solid - plus, it was the first time I
really got any recognition as a newer author, and thus holds a special
place in my heart.<br />
<em>Sinous</em>: I really enjoyed making and playing this map. The
mechanic is enjoyable, the tiles are nice, and the gold and mines are
well placed. I believe this map marks a point in my carreer where I
believe I began to grow as a map maker.<br />
<em>Stone Strewn</em>: After browsing through a Mr. Sept's maps, I was
instantly infatuated with the stone - like tiles and just had to make a
map like it. The tiles and gameplay are at peak, the presentation is
good, and the level of difficulty is far more adequate in comparison to
many of my earlier maps.<br />
<em>Under the Influence</em>: This map is actually one of my more
interesting ones, mostly because the concept came to me in a dream in
which I was sky diving. It was so fresh and exciting to me, I decided
that I would have to try to recreate the experience with NED. This is
what I came up with, and I really enjoy it.<br />
<em>Top Hats</em>: As much as I love the tiles in this level, they're not
the reason I chose to comment on it. The idea behind this map was to
attempt to use excellent presentation - to give the level as much depth
as possible without slopping on as many switches as possible. I thought
I was reasonably successful ^.^.<br />
<em>Dracula's Igloo</em>: Another conceptual map, my latest map feels
like another threshold for me in map making; an evolution of my style,
per se. I'd like to focus on giving my maps even better presentation
and atmosphere, and this one was modeled after a sea scape. Whie I
don't feel like it had the tightest game play, I felt like it had a
much stronger ambience than many of my other maps.<br />
<em>04-1 - dotCom</em>: I must say, if I had to pick a favorite level
from my little known level pack, Radical, this would probably <br>
be it. I love the style of the level, the drone paths some are of my
best, and the difficulty properly balances challenge with fun.<br />
<em>04-4 - Riverboat</em>: Another level coming from my radical pack, I
wanted to give the idea of slinking through weedy river darkness in a
boat. Fun, good drone paths, etc.<br />
<em>Machina Pulse</em>: Whaddya know, this one looks like an elephant! It
also plays smoothly, quickly, and has what I believe to be a rockin'
tileset. While I felt unrestricted both making and playing this level,
the reason I enjoy it so much is it's sense of rhythm.<br />
<em>Ruff in the Jungle!</em>: Last, but certainly not least, we have my
dearly held collaboration with krusch! One night, I decided to approach
krusch to collab, and this is what came of it - an organic, free
flowing level.</p>
<p>
Man, you will probably have someone new up here next week. I
half-guarantee it!</p>
<h1>Nterviewed</h1>
<p>By Tanner Rogalsky</p>
<br />
<p> Man, when I joined (which wasn't really that long ago in the grand
scheme of things), <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/astheoceansblue""
 title=""astheoceansblue""><em>astheoceansblue</em></a> was <em>the</em>
mapmaker. At least, he was to my NUMA-ignorant brain-head. He was like
a minor deity. It was wild. The atob article is one of the first things
I remember reading on the N Wiki. Good times, good times. <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/26775"" title=""Pagoder Ass-mylum."">Pagoder
Ass-mylum.</a> 
</p>
<p> Hyphens are pretty neat.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Who do you make maps for?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong><a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Mechtradevil"" title=""Mechtradevil"">Mechtradevil</a>
&lt;3
</p>
<p> <strong>Tanner:</strong> Where do you draw inspiration from?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong>Everything I experience. My map <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/map/7574"" title=""'Sleepy Hollow"">'<em>Sleepy
Hollow</em></a>' was based on a dream I had of spider webs that tripped
memories of the Tim Burton movie, while 'Harold Weathervein' was a NED
translation of the lyrics for the song of the same name by the band
Cursive. Other times I glean inspiration directly from other maps or
author styles. It depends what my head's doing at the time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Episodic or Standalone? Why?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong>Standalone gives you more room to breath, I
find, you don't have to think about the flow of the episode or the
worth of the gold to such a degree: you can experiment more freely.
Episodic is more rigid, and much more of a challenge to get right as
there's a great deal of stipulation involved. Whereas an episode
working as a standalone is a very subjective thing, I find a standalone
working as an episode to be much more objective. I'm rambling a little,
aren't I? The answer is: I couldn't possibly decide and I think it
would weaken me as a map maker if I tried to.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> Do you feel like you've stayed relevant to the
map making and playing scene?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong>I find the tone of this question is fitting to
the current feel of NUMA: it feels more like a contest rather than a
collective at times. Saying that, I've not failed to notice the impact
of my presence here: I see people emulating things I create often
enough to realize my worth to the community as a designer. I guess I'll
stay relevant in that respect as long as such things remain apparent.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What do you do with constructive criticism
when you're one of the most experienced mappers on NUMA?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong>I lash out at the smallest person/animal near
me with the heaviest/sharpest thing to hand, then I take a deep breath
try to take the comments on-board and make my maps more than they are.
</p>
<p> <br>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What did you think of that ""Everyone loves
atob, but I want him to die"" <a
 href=""http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=18260""
 title=""topic"">topic</a> ?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong>Firstly, I would like to say the reaction to
that thread was massively unexpected and absolutely lovely. It was an
inevitable reaction - given the temperament of the aggressor - to the
way I handle myself on NUMA; I try my best to give worthwhile and
constructive criticism and that tends to go against the standard 'back
patting' mentality that seems to be rife on NUMA. I can see how it
could be construed as aloof and elitist, but that's neither the intent
nor truth of it. Some people just don't like the way I operate, which
is fine and fair. Those people are idiots, though ;)<br>
<br>
<strong>Tanner:</strong> What's on the horizon for atob?<br>
<strong>atob: </strong>A couple of cool sounding projects. One of
which is very exciting indeed, but there's nothing I can give away
without ruining it. *winks at the <a
 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/Kablizzy"" title=""conspirators"">conspirators</a>*
Other than that, I hope progression, evolution, innovation and as close
to fresh design as I can get.

Kablizzy is somehow involved. I'm so turning TSN into a gossip rag.

</p>
<br />
<p>
<em>Ditt Doot:</em> One time on IRC, 9400 said he wanted a tileset, so I
just launched N and didn't know what the hell I was gonna do and this
resulted.</p><p>
<em>If I Were a Carp:</em> I think this is probably my best map. I love
the idea of it, and the gameplay. Short and sweet. Also, the name comes
from the Final Fantasy (Owen Pallett) song If I Were a Carp.</p><p>
<em>Juicy with a Z: </em>I /think/ this map was inspired by a Senday
map, not sure. The title derives from a Midnight Brown song Nasty with
Two S's. Also, I don't know exactly where you put the Z, maybe
replacing the C?</p><p>
<em>Ekang/warparasol:</em> I just had the idea of epic-ness, and I
recently played a little flash game that was a platformer where at on
part you walk along the spine of some dinosaur skeleton, and I really
enjoyed the idea so I used it in the map. Too bad the skeleton in my
map doesn't look anything close to a skeleton. :/</p><p>
<em>Deliverater:</em> Now this map is weird. I just started out in NED
playing around trying to make a map, but I REALLY hated the tiles, so I
screwed it up with a snotload of three-tiles everywhere and added those
weird little mouse gold pattern thingies. I'd say the map came out
pretty well. The title either comes from some gibberish I made up or
from some Beastie Boys song when I misheard a word by one of them.</p><p>
<em>--. .. .-. .-.. ..-. .-. .. . -. -..: </em>The first map after
deleting all my old ones. I kinda had a rough idea in my head of what
it would be. Basically, I just tried to remember what Aju's map A
Thousand Dollar Ski Trip looked like, and that's what I got. The name
also came from a dream I had, and my obsession of cryptography and
morse and other stuff.</p><p>
<em>Dying with Empathy, AKA Awesome Forces!:</em> The title comes from me
randomly asking Amlt for a name for the map without even showing it to
him, and the title of The Aquabats song Awesome Forces! The tiles
aren't much, but I love the arrangement of the objects.</p><p>
<em>Return to Hot Chicken:</em> I was blown away by Heartview's Chicken
in a Banana Tree, so I ripped it off with this. ;_; The title also
comes from a sweet-as-gravy song by Yo La Tengo.</p><p>
<em>We Are: </em>I reallllllly wanted to make a map that was tough, so I
just made a map that was not too tough but atleast presented some
challenge. The title comes from a song by the Korean pop band Deux.</p><p>
<em>Teeth revealed and weird hair and eyes:</em> This map reminds me of
Aju soooo much, just the tiles. Honestly, I was gonna add more stuff to
the map than just exit, ninja, gold, and the gauss, but I guess I kinda
forgot. &gt;_&lt;</p><p>
<em>Atlantis to Interzone:</em> I think this was inspired by a Metanet
map, I can't remember the name at the moment though. I think the tiles
were kinda same in the way, but a bit more simple, and the gameplay was
definitely wayyy different. This title too like almost all the others
comes from a song, Atlantis to Interzone by Klaxons. (I /GOTTA/ stop
using song names for titles, 'cause it's really making this artist
commentary REALLY dull. :/)</p>

<h1>Artist
Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>One of
my favourites, <a href=""http://www.pastebin.ca/raw/663332"">Sendy</a>!</p>
<br />
<p>
<em>Madlands:</em> My first submission to NUMA, and my second map ever
built, I look back on this with pride. N designing took me about two
years to master and for a long time I didn't feel like I had full
command of the N gamut like many of the authors I admire did; though
obviously I continued to try my best, despite what seemed to be a shaky
start.</p><p>
In some ways it seems flukey. The enemy use was minimal but effective,
buying some licence for the excessive mine 'nets' which only serve the
purpose of making the deaths from falling in very lively. Even at this
age I was experimenting with unusual trapdoor techniques (go me!) and
many of my trademarks were in place, such as the inaccessible
'forbidden ground' complete with aesthetic objects which can't be
reached.</p><p>
<em>Ultravisitor (DDA)</em>: My first DDA, and the most amazingly fun to
make. When I started, I wasn't convinced that I'd be able to see it
through, but then, seemingly, miracles began to happen and I realized I
could get what I wanted with a compromise between planning and happy
accidents. The art of the DDA was revealed to me and in those early
days what mattered were things like style, the route, rhythm and
technique. In a way I prefer those days to the modern, open, high-paced
DDA's - clever though these things are.</p><p>
For a while I entertained the thought that maybe I'd be primarily a DDA
artist since this DDA was my first map to make a big noise in the
community!</p><p>
<em>Death Star 1</em>: A peculiar map, inspired by Formica who back then
was TDL. TDL inspired me a lot, and when I saw his Death Star I figured
I might be able to do something like it but with more structure. Of
course, back then I was a feral creature and I had no strategies to
safeguard from my tendency toward extreme difficulty. As a result this
map is up there with Mount Doom and MTI in terms of challenge, but is
hopefully atmospheric enough to reward perseverance. I've never beaten
it, but I posted a demo where I came close.</p><p>
<em>Platformula (In-game)</em>: The next map was a choice between
Waterworx and Platformula, as they were both made at the same time and
mark a milestone in my career as a designer. I chose Platformula
because I prefer it, though they are both very hard. At this stage I
was beginning to get a feel for what I thought was fun and what was not
in N - a subject which is very subtle and fleeting to a beginner (as
much of NUMA will attest).</p><p>
<em>Obfuscate</em>: Flawed though it is, this map is from a landmark in
my development where I started being able to make maps that were easier
but still fun. From this point on my maps show more restraint in
general and are made to appeal to a wider audience. It was difficult to
make this change since I relied on challenges for fun, and now my maps
seem much easier to me, but I'm thankful for the change. And naturally
I still stay in touch with the Dark Side from time to time...</p><p>
<em>Fetch!</em>: This was part of the first episode I ever designed,
during a period of inspiration from LittleViking's episodes.</p><p>
In this time I pulled out all of the 'make it easy' stops as far as
they can go. In fact I think I broke some of them. You can see that I
stuck to a limited palette of enemies but made it more interesting by
having it work differently on the return journey. Although the
difficulty is easy, the fun and challenge comes from the length. This
is one of my favourite there-and-back levels.</p><p>
<em>Skittish</em>: Now I'm trying to bring back a bit of difficulty,
without going overboard and making it possible only for saints and
martyrs. Also my object placement is tigher resulting in a lower
average object count. I'm very pleased with how this all works together
and looks - particularly I liked the mine section and it felt I'd
worked out how to get the most out of a minefield with seemingly
'random' placement.</p><p>
<em>What One-ways Were Made For</em>: Yes, I think this is clever. No, I
don't think it's anything like Platformpuzzle from the game (like some
bright spark commenting did) - that was a maze of sorts whilst in this
you are restricted in a manner which prevents you moving right or down
(essentially 'backtracking'), with the provision that you can pass
through and around as many times you like to collect all the goodies
(and the edited spring MAKES this map, so I don't want to hear any
purists arguing about it).</p><p>
Calculating the perfect route for time is the ultimate puzzle goal of
this map, but for most people, surviving to the end is enough.</p><p>
<em>De'liver</em>: Here's a map showing how I was eventually inspired by
the best of the abstract movement, i.e. krusch et al. I can't put exact
names to it because I can never keep track of who does what exactly but
the point here is I decided to let myself be inspired by other authors
as opposed to being a fairly insular map making environment. So far I
haven't been accused of style biting and I've been inspired by many
different authors, so that's good. This map is highly nonlinear which
also marks another trend I developed with my maps at this time, which
was to actively keep track of all the different routes and
possibilities for the player as I design the map.</p><p>
<em>Never Stop</em>: One hundred percent pure me, I just love this map.
It flows from section to section like a dream and the challenge of
getting the gold is just enough to push me without driving me infirm.
See the tileset piece slightly to the left of the middle, with the
smooth curves and lots of mines along the bottom part? For some reason
I find that sexy. Do you think I should seek help?</p><p>
Anyway, this map is probably my personal favourite right now, and I've
heard from the comments that it works well on guys, too. So there you
have it.</p>

<a href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/superguh_007"">superguh_007</a>:<br />
2.5/5<br />
I don't normally mind these ""flow"" maps. This one wasn't the best
example, though. I found it very difficult to maintain the movement in
this map because it was non-intuitive and overall, difficult. It was
very hard to avoid things like chainguns and missiles because when you
have this race, because I would invariably be killed by them while I
was trying to figure out what to do next.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-If you do figure out the ""Groove"", it's a nice, fun race.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Hard to follow.<br />
-Difficult at times.<br />
-Not Great on the eyes.<br />

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/mrgy05"">mrgy05</a>:<br />
4/5<br />
A pretty map to be sure. Lots of work put into the center tileset and
the all around tileset just looks fantastic. However, while the left
side plays out like a fun, missile avoiding jumper, the right side is
in comparison, easy. Also, we've gone up and down walls with missiles
and gauss turrets following us a thousand times, it would have been
nice to see more jumping on the bounce blocks. Very unique use of
normal doors on the sides.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Good use of Normal Doors.<br />
Beautiful Tileset.<br />
A Good Jumper.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Boring Right Side.<br />
<br />

2/5<br />
This map is the same thing. Jump, straddle the block, jump, straddle
the block, jump. Here's a game. Try and guess how frustrating it is to
have to do the same thing over and over again because you slipped up a
bit. It only nets a two because the descent is a good bit of fun.<br />
<br />
Pros: <br />
Fun return trip.<br />
Clear style.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Annoyingly Repetitive.<br />

 href=""http://numa.notdot.net/user/hellomoto69"">hellomoto69</a>:<br />
2/5<br />
A nice volcano tileset that is essentially brought down by the
thirty-some-odd stars that are floating around it. Although the author
handles the use of the stars well, they aren't tremendously difficult
as they are annoying. There's also gallons more gold than any ninja
could possibly need; to include this as a level into the game would be
to release the player from getting any gold on any other levels. In
fact, with the gold deposit in the bottom right corner alone, there's
no reason why Norman should risk his life to get any gold elsewhere in
the game. Plus, the guy's screen name has ""69"" in it.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Nice Tileset.<br />
Sometimes Challenging.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Annoyingly Repetitive. (That one's for true.)<br />
Too much Gold.<br />
Bland.<br />

1.5/5<br />
The only DDA on the list, the only rated map on the list, and finally,
the oldest map on the list are where our last map gets us. It's also
probably the most boring map on the list. I'm a man who loves his
DDA's, but this one just didn't appeal to me. It was slow, but still
managed to be short. Close calls are virtually unseen in this DDA, and
the way the ""laserdome"" was handled was just miserable. I felt like I
did a lot of waiting in this map. Cool finish onto the platform, though.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Cool finish.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Boring.<br />
Short/Slow.<br />
Bad use of laser drones.<br />

Commentary of the Third Kind</h1>
<p>Not
possibly as good as last week's, <a
 href=""http://pastebin.ca/raw/678597"">Jig</a>!</p>
<br />
<p>
<em>Eleven Ring Circus</em>: In my early days at Numa, I feel I drew most
inspiration from one tktktk. I became enthralled with his ""one-shape""
jumper puzzles. Perhaps the best part about these puzzles was the
absence of enemies. Gravity is your only foe, now go jump. It's a
great concept. I strove to make maps just like these, because I loved
his so much. I think this map is probably one of my best. I just
created a ring, and it looked pretty cool, so I made the puzzle out of
it.<br />
<br />
I later got pretty bloody sick of making maps like this, but I look
back at this period of my Numa career and smile. With regard to this
map in particular, it's quite aesthetically pleasing, both in the
presentation of the tiles and the standard plus-sign gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Stage</em>: I had forgotten about this map until scrolling through
all my maps to find ten for this set. This was a vent map I made with
Linus, Jerrod, and the late Aju. There are neat, not-too-overused
mechanics for this level. Grab the switches to make the path.
Otherwise, it's frightfully simple and just a fun map, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
When I was making this map with the other guys, I suddenly found myself
enjoying the concept of a vent map immensely. Every time the others
made a suggestion, I would embrace it, and fit it into my map in a way
that I liked. The best example was, Aju said ""Make a circle in the
middle of your map"" as the first suggestion, and I made that...I don't
know what to call it, but I love it. I shudder at the gold placement
and haplessly placed enemies, but the mechanics and tileset made up for
it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Nine Chambers</em>: Possibly one of my greatest triumphs, this DDA
was the first map I made that hit top rated. It's also now my first
map on record at Numa, as I used to delete my maps like a faggot. This
is my only KRADDA, because I'm not particularly skilled in that field.
Looking back, it's just not that great. But it was amazing for its
time and I still look back in awe of my talent, which is now waning
quickly.<br />
 <br />
There's a decent variety of propulsion methods, but a lot of launch
pads, and a lot of gold delay. And no close calls. What I tried to
focus on was actually the rocket's passage through walls. I seemed
overly fascinated with the trap door + locked door glitch, and overused
the hell out of it, but it definitely adds an element of excitement to
the rocket's path, while the ninja floats around not doing much.<br />

<br />
<em>Scrambled Bramble</em>: For some reason, many see this to be a
defining map for my career. It was the start of a horribly
dead-horse-beaten style (tiles that look like vines, I guess) that
several of us used over a few months. I realized when I was making the
map that simplicity is highly appreciated, and thrived on it in the
placement of the door switches. It's an easy map to beat, and a
slightly challenging map to take all gold on.<br />
<br />
The high praise I received from the people on the comments of this map
really helped me take my mapmaking to a new stage, when I created some
of my greatest works.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Multi-tasking</em>: This is probably my most innovative map concept
to date. Playing it in userlevels is highly unsatisfying, so don't.
Basically, you delete one of the ninjas, and play the level as you
normally would. Then delete the ninja you just played the map with and
put back the other one and play back the demo. If he completes the
level, you win.<br />
<br />
Neither half of this map is really that fun by itself. But you have to
think, visualize, as you're playing one half, what the enemies on the
other half might be doing at that instant. Playing it with that
mindset makes for a very intense but fun experience. Then again, you
could just zoom through and flukily win, but where's the fun in that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Onomatopoeia</em>: Well, I'm certainly proud of this one. It came in
stride with ""Where did YOU come from?!,"" ""Squib,"" and ""Thump!"" Around
that time, I had decided innovation was more important than how fun a
map is, and I made some crazy interesting maps. This is my favorite of
the bunch. I like the way Linus described this map. It relies on the
success rate of teleporters (which, as we know, can be unreliable in
playable maps) to achieve its means. You have to know you can't
approach a teleporter from the right or left, or you get smashed.<br />
<br />
I think this map is bleeding style. The gold placement and ninty
degree angles (though they provide little flow) satisfy most any
aesthetic desire you could possibly have, and the concept in itself
certainly makes this one worth playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Glitchtastic 6 - Points for Style</em>: This and the other maps in
the series are probably the thing I'm most famous for at the moment.
In a true affront to sniperdom, this particular installment has been in
the top thirty maps for about a month and a week now. This is my
favorite of the series because, as its name suggests, it's very
stylish. I also like it because it's got more variety and interesting
jumpy things (that's a technical term) than its predecessors.<br />
<br />
The Metanet community can certainly expect more from the Glitchtastic
series, as it's the biggest ass ratings padder I've ever created...I
mean...because I love making them and reading your comments.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Feels like...fascination...</em>: This was the map I returned to Numa
with fairly recently. I couldn't stay away. This is one of my faves,
but not because of the gameplay or anything about the finished product
of the map. I love it because I didn't think of that drone path dealy
until I was about halfway done with the map. It was a complete
afterthought. So, as that works so well in the map, I just love it.<br />
<br />
As far as playing the map goes, you'll need a good deal of speed, but
more helpful is precision. If you can make the required jumps the
first time you attempt them, it's just a slightly tricky puzzle. I
find this one very fun, and it's probably in my top ten favorites of
mine. <br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Relic</em>:I adore this. I just adore it. I don't care what all the
other people are saying/said about it. It was inspired by the classic
""Clearway"" by Lucidium. I think it accomplishes the same aim, but with
a bit more style and a lot more flow. You have to be super fast on
this map, so don't get discouraged if you don't beat it on your first
several tries.<br />
<br />
In its early development, this map lacked flow, and had the cruddiest
gold placement imaginable. After I cleaned it up, though, I really
consider this a good looking, well executed, fun map. <br />
<br />
<br />
<em>The Dreaming Tree</em>: Well, to top off the list, my greatest map,
to date. I can safely say this is the only map ever made by anyone
that I actually have emotional ties to. I don't know why. Perhaps
it's because, as I made the map, I was very depressed, and channeled my
emotions into a map that depicts a withered, dead tree. Something
about the map made me happier. And I still can't reason why.<br />
<br />
It's a bit of a throwback to old mine jumpers like ""Crumble"" and ""Rite
of Passage,"" but it's less cluttered, more simple, and much prettier.
The map as a whole is not only very fun to play but also...just
gorgeous. You can't look at it without wanting to play it. Eye
candy? Perhaps.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'll make a better map than The Dreaming Tree. It's
actually pretty unlikely. I'm slowly fading away from the Numa scene,
and, while I'll likely never leave, my contributions have been and will
continue to be getting fewer and fewer. As for now, I'm happy to look
back through these maps, relive all the memories, and talk a bit about
my favorite ten to the community. Thank you for this opportunity, Alex.<br />

In the description, the author writes, ""Fun map..."". Honestly, I
thought it was
going to be. I did have fun for the first little while, the switches
were
challenging but not overly difficult once you figured out how to get
them. The
goddamn gold, on the other hand, is just ridiculous. Some of it's
fairly easy
but there are certain pieces that are just annoying. I, for one, don't
equate
annoying with fun.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Mildly clever tileset. It really was a map that consisted of crevices.<br />
- Decent problem solving. You can't just go right at some of the
switches.
There's a dance that needs to be carried out.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- AGD's too hard. I don't think the difference in difficulty between a
completion and an AGD (or even a mostly AGD) should be so large.<br />
- Turrets behind bounce blocks aren't cool. They just aren't.<br />

I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but this reminded be a lot
of 16-3. I
actually really enjoyed it, though. It was different enough to be
called a remix
instead of a ripoff. I might have found a way to make it a little
harder but I
did still die twice. The rotating drones were a welcome introduction as
well as
the thwump-elevator.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Fun. Not exceptionally fun, but I wasn't bored.<br />
- I have a soft-spot of Metanet remixes. I don't know why.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Too easy.<br />
- This is still a remix and, as much as that doesn't bother me, I have
to
mention it.<br />

This is a tileset so it's going to be a little different. I personally,
can't
make a decent tileset to save my life so I'm always sort of in awe when
people
can churn them out like it's nothing. I wandered around in this one for
a while
and I wasn't struck by any sort of inspiration. It's a decent tileset,
I guess.
Visually, it's alright. The moving about is fine. But that's all it is.
It's
just fine. You could probably do something with lasers. It would
probably be
mediocre.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Visually appealing.<br />
- Cohesive.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Didn't allow more movement to be as fluid as I like it to be.<br />
- It's just so... ordinary.<br />

When you play this, you'll get halfway through and suddenly the level
explodes.
Seriously. I was like, ""Holy shit."" The first half is sort of boring
but the
second half is utterly frantic. You have to understand that Musicwmusic
makes
friggin' strange levels. Musicwmusic levels are to NUMA as noise metal
is to
music. You either love it or you hate it.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Second half is hella intense.<br />
- It isn't dumbed down.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- First half is boring.<br />
- It isn't dumbed down.<br />

This map is not good. It's not detestable, but it's just not good. The
most
important thing in a survival is the experience changes over time. The
fact that
that is vital is only too apparent in this map. The only thing that
changes in
this map is your position as you collect the gold. The gold isn't even
especially difficult to collect. The most likely outcome if you're,
like I was,
playing the level in your user levels is that you collect all the gold
and then
just stand in one place, avoiding drones until you run out of time.
It's
completely unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- The level is designed well. I would enjoy it if it wasn't a survival.<br />
- I can dig drone levels every so often.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Waaaaay too easy.<br />
- Experience does not change over time.<br />

Uh, could someone please volunteer to do this week's Random Rates? It'd
really make it easier for me!</p>"
