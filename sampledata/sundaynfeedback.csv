40,An idea - Sunday N 2.0?,"After the Sunday N's been laid to rest for a few weeks/months/ice ages, we could make a new newsletter where writing and map selection responsibility's handed about between guest authors. It could include semi-regular features selected from what's available at the author's discretion, as well as the compulsory choice of the week's maps. That way, only this week's author's responsible for lateness (well, &quot;responsible&quot; is the wrong word because it implies that anything bad which happens is all his/her fault, but I'm sure you know what I mean). It wouldn't be brilliant, but it'd be something, and it might be interesting to see different members of the community take the reins. Obviously each author would have to be a) well-known/liked/respected and b) sure of being able to write for the week.

16,Cool,"I like the Sunday N, and have read all of them. Just a tip that I have noticed, over the 16 issues, just about all of the maps you have said are &quot;the top maps of the week&quot; are by the same people that are long veterans of N. Sure, they may be the top maps, but I would like to see some new and upcoming authors posted, having their maps on display. I'm frankly getting a bit sick of seeing the same names over and over again on the Sunday N's. However I respect the way that you have made this; and I really appreciate the time you spend on these.

I see many maps that are really fun, and after all, N is a computer game to me. It might mean more to some, but I know that a computer game should be enjoyed. And whether a map looks good or has a big-name author on it doesn't really mean a thing to me. I love maps that make me smile, and make me think,'Woah, this is really cool!' And sometimes these maps are the really good maps that you post.

I don't know really, maybe Nterview an upcoming author, one that shows good promise. I haven't been on for a while, and that has woken me up to the reality of things on NUMA.

Sorry for posting such a large comment.

Now, I understand that you might find that uninteresting, but let me at least point out that I've featured martyr recently, who happens to be a new author. If there are new authors out there making stuff I enjoy, it'll get in. As I've stated previously, I'm not making an exception for newbies just because they're new. They get the same treatment as anyone else.

As for Nterviewing, it's not I who chooses who is Nterviewed or conducts the Nterviews, so you'll have to take that to Tanner if you want to discuss further.

I'm perfectly fine sitting on my lazy ass and waiting for the Random Rates and Artist Commentary to be done. I'm just drawing out the conclusion for you.

Now take it out of your goddamn vagina, stop whimpering about an erroneous name, get your own face in the community and do something with your time instead of complaining about what you, the consumer, has shit all to say about. You're not paying me for this, except in spiritual fuck yous, so maybe shutting the fuck up would help us all out a little? That's just what I think.

You don't even know what you're complaining about. Alex has these done consistently on time. The Sunday N, however, requires collaboration from multiple sources and these sources aren't always on time. Christ, I wasn't.

Alex has the prerogative to perceive you members justly. You ceaselessly lament his every word, and incessantly complain about his every action. He has not done a thing to disservice you, yet you can acquire this immoral attitude to disservice him. The only intention his tone is distasteful is because of your frequent animosity towards him.
